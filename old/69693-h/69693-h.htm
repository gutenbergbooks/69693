<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span> is the most popular of the arts. It fills
man’s breast with a melancholy joy. Even the brute
creation is not insensible to its power. Yet, at its
best, music is a haughty, exclusive being, and not
without reason are training, practice, talent, and
the development of that talent, required for the
understanding of her secrets. “One wishes to be
heard with the intellect, by one’s equals; emotion
becomes only women, but music should strike fire
from the mind of a man.” In some such strain as
this, Beethoven himself once spoke, and we know
how slowly the works of the great symphonist found
a hearing and recognition from the general public.</p>

<p>Yet, who is there to-day who does not know the
name of Beethoven? Who is there that, hearing
one of his compositions, does not feel the presence
of a sublime, all-ruling power—of a power that
springs from the deepest sources of all life? His
very name inspires us with a feeling of veneration,
and we can readily believe the accounts that have
come down to us; how even strangers drew back
with a species of awe, before this man of imposing
appearance, spite of his smallness of stature, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
his rounded shoulders, erect head, wavy hair and
piercing glance. Who has not heard of the two
charcoal-burners who suddenly stopped their heavily
laden vehicle when they met, in a narrow pass,
this “crabbed musician,” so well known to all
Vienna, and who was wont to stand and think, and
then, humming, to go his way, moving about bee-like
through nature from sunrise, with his memorandum book
in his hand.</p>

<p>We are moved with the same feeling of respect
that moved those common men, when we hear only
Beethoven’s name, but how much more powerfully
are we stirred when we hear his music! We feel
in that music the presence of the spirit that animates
and sustains the world, and which is continually
calling new life into existence. Even the
person who is not a musician himself may feel, in
these mighty productions, the certainty of the
presence of the Creator of all things. Their tones
sound to him like the voice of man’s heart of
hearts, the joys and sorrows of which Beethoven
has laid bare to us. We feel convinced, when we
hear them, that the person who in them speaks to
us has, in very deed, something to tell us, something
of our own life; because he lived and felt
more deeply than we what we all live and feel, and
loved and suffered what we all love and suffer, more
deeply than any other child of dust. In Beethoven,
we meet with a personage really great, both in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
mind and heart, one who was able to become a
sublime model to us, because life and art were serious
things with him, and one who made it his duty
“to live not for himself, but for other men.” The
high degree of self-denying power found in this
phenomenon of art, it is that has such an elevating
effect on us. The duties of life and the tasks
of the artist he discharged with equal fidelity.
His life was the foundation on which the superstructure
of his works rose. His greatness as a
man was the source of his greatness as an artist.
The mere story of his life, given here in outline,
reveals to us the internal springs of his artistic
creations, and we must perforce admit, that the
history of Beethoven’s life is a part of the history
of the higher intellectual life of our time and of
humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludwig van Beethoven</span> was baptized in
Bonn on the 17th of December, 1770. We
know only this the date of his baptism, with
any certainty, and hence the 17th of December
is assumed to be his birthday likewise.</p>

<p>His father, Johann van Beethoven, was a
singer in the chapel of the Elector, in Bonn.
The family, however, had come originally from
the Netherlands. Beethoven’s grandfather
came to Bonn in 1732 after willfully leaving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
parental roof in consequence of a quarrel. He
had attracted attention as a bass singer in the
church and the theater, and was made director
of the court band in 1763. By his industry, he
had founded a family, was earning a respectable
livelihood, and had won for himself the
personal regard of the community. He did,
besides, a small business in wines, but this,
which was only accessory to his calling as a
musician, contributed to undermine both his
own happiness and his son’s. His wife, Josepha
Poll, fell a victim to the vice of intemperance,
and, in consequence, it at last became
necessary to confine her in a convent in
Cologne. Unfortunately, the only surviving
son inherited the vice of his mother.</p>

<p>“Johann van Beethoven was given to the tasting
of wine from a very early age,” says the
account of his playmates. It was not long before
this weakness got the upper hand to such
an extent that his family and home suffered
greatly. It finally led to his discharge from
his position. Stephan van Breuning, our own
Beethoven’s friend in youth, saw him, on one
occasion, liberate the drunken father out of the
hands of the police in the public streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>We here get a glimpse at a period in Beethoven’s
youth, which put the strength of his
mind as well as the goodness of his heart to
the test. For in consequence of the very respectable
position occupied by his grandfather,
of his own early appointment as court organist,
and of the rapid development of his
talent, Beethoven soon enjoyed the society of
the higher classes, and was employed in the
capacity of musician in the families of the
nobility and at court. Yet, we are told, whenever
it happened that he and his two younger
brothers were obliged to take their intoxicated
father home, they always performed that
disagreeable task with the utmost tenderness.
He was never known to utter a hard or unkind
word about the man who had made his
youth so sunless, and he never failed to resent
it when a third person spoke uncharitably of
his father’s frailty. The reserve and a certain
haughtiness, however, which marked his disposition
as a youth and a man, are traceable to
these early harsh experiences.</p>

<p>And who knows the complications which
caused misfortune to get the upper hand here!
True, we are told that “Johann van Beethoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
was of a volatile and flighty disposition;” but
even his playmates, when he was a boy, had
nothing bad to say of his character. Anger
and stubbornness seem, indeed, to have been
the inheritance of his Netherland nature; and
these our hero also displayed to no small extent.
But while the grandfather had earned a very
good position for himself, and always so deported
himself that young Beethoven might take
him as an example, and loved to speak of him
as a “man of honor,” his father was never
more than a singer in the chapel, on a small
salary. But, notwithstanding his comparatively
humble social position, he had made a
mistake in marrying below his station.</p>

<p>Johann van Beethoven took Magdalena
Kewerich, of Ehrenbreitstein, to wife, in 1763.
She is described as a “pretty and slender
woman.” She had served as a chambermaid,
for a time, in some of the families of the great,
had married young, and was left a widow at the
age of nineteen. Johann’s marriage to this
woman was not acceptable to the court <i>capellmeister</i>,
and so it happened that he was obliged
to leave the home in which he had thus far
lived with his lonely father, and move into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
wing of the house, number 515, in Bonn
street, where his son Ludwig, the subject of
this sketch, was born.</p>

<p>The young wife brought no property to her
husband. Several children were born to the
newly married couple in quick succession. Of
these, Karl, born in 1774 and Johann in 1766,
play some part in Beethoven’s life. The growth
of the family was so rapid that it was not long
before they felt the burthen of pecuniary
distress. The grandfather, who was well to
do, helped them, at first. His stately figure
in his red coat, with his massive head and “big
eyes,” remained fixed in the boy Ludwig’s
memory, although he was only three years of
age when his grandfather died. The child
was, indeed, tenderly attached to him. As
the father’s poverty increased, he made some
efforts to improve his condition. But they
were of no avail; for his deportment was only
“passable” and his voice “was leaving him.”
He now had recourse to teaching, and obtained
employment in the theater, for he played the
violin also. Sickness, however, soon eat up
what was left of his little fortune. Their
furniture and table ware followed their silver-service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and linen—“which one might have
drawn through a ring,”—to the pawn-shop;
and now the father’s poverty contributed only
to make him, more and more, the victim of
his weakness for the cup.</p>

<p>But there was even now one star of hope in
the dreary firmament of his existence—his son
Ludwig’s talent for music. This talent showed
itself in very early childhood, and could not,
by any possibility, escape the observation of
the father, who, after all, was himself a “good
musician.” And, although the father was not
destined to live to see his son in the zenith of
his success, it was his son’s talent alone that
saved the family from ruin and their name
from oblivion, for with the birth of Beethoven’s
younger brother, Johann, and of a sister
who died shortly after, the circumstances of
the family became still more straightened.
Mozart had been in Bonn a short time before,
and it occurred to the father to train his son
to be a second little Mozart, and, by traveling
with him, earn the means of subsistence of
which the family stood so sorely in need.
And so the boy was rigidly kept to his lessons
on the piano and violin. His daily exercises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
on these instruments must have been a severer
task on him than would seem to be necessary
in a regular course of musical training.
He used to be taken from his playing
with other children to practice, and friends of
his youth tell us how they saw him standing
on a stool before the piano and cry while he
practiced his lessons. Even the rod was called
into requisition in his education, and the expostulations
of friends could not dissuade the
father from such relentless severity. But the
end was attained. Regular and persevering
exercise, laid the foundation of a skill in the
art of music, which led him before the public
when only seven years of age. On the
26th of March (by a strange coincidence the
day of the month on which Beethoven died),
the father announced, in a paper published in
Cologne, that “his son, aged six years, would
have the honor to wait on the public with several
concertos for the piano, when, he flattered
himself, he would be able to afford a distinguished
audience a rich treat; and this all the
more since he had been favored with a hearing
by the whole court, who listened to him with
the greatest pleasure.” The child, to enhance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the surprise, was made one year younger in this
announcement than he was in reality; and this
led Beethoven himself into an error as to his
age, which he did not discover until he was
nearly forty.</p>

<p>We need say but little concerning his other
teachers when a youth. His great school was
want, which urged him to follow and practice
his art, so that he might master it, and, with
its assistance, make his way through the
world. When Beethoven grew to be eight
years of age, he had as a teacher, in addition
to his father, the vocalist Tobias Pfeiffer, for a
whole year. Pfeiffer lived in the Beethoven
family. He was a skillful pianist. Beethoven
considered him one of the teachers to whom
he was most indebted, and was subsequently
instrumental in procuring assistance for him
from Vienna. But we may form some idea of
the nature of his instruction, and of the mode
of living in the family, from the fact, attested by
Beethoven’s neighbors, that it frequently happened
that Pfeiffer, after coming home with
the father late in the night from the tavern,
took young Ludwig out of bed and kept him
at the piano practicing till morning. Yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
success attendant on this instruction was such,
even now, that when the boy, Beethoven and
his teacher, who performed on the flute, played
variations together, the people in the streets
stopped and listened to their delightful music.
In 1781, when Ludwig was ten years old, he
traveled to Holland with his mother, played
in the houses of the great, and astonished
every one by his skill. The profits from this
journey, however, cannot have been very
large. When the boy was questioned about
them, he replied: “The Dutch are a niggardly
set; I shall never visit Holland again.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, he turned his attention
also to the study of the organ. Under the
guidance of a certain Brother Willibald, of a
neighboring Franciscan monastery, he soon
became so proficient on that instrument, that
he was able to act as assistant organist at divine
service. But his principal teachers here
were the old electoral court organist, van den
Eeden, and afterwards, his successor, Christian
Gottlob Neefe. In what regards composition
the latter was the first to exercise any real influence
on Beethoven, and Beethoven, in after
years, thanked him for the good advice he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
given him—advice which had contributed so
much to his success in the “divine art.” He
concludes a letter to Neefe as follows: “If
I should turn out some day to be a great man,
you will have contributed to making me such.”
Neefe came originally from Saxony. As an
organist, he had all the characteristics of the
North German artists; but, on the other hand,
he had, as a composer, a leaning towards the sonata-style
introduced by Ph. E. Bach. He was a
man of broad general education, and the form
of his artistic productions was almost faultless.
Such was young Beethoven’s proficiency at the
age of eleven, in 1782, that Neefe was able to
appoint him his “substitute,” and thus to pave
the way for his appointment as court organist.
We owe to him the first published account of
Beethoven, and from that account we learn
that the great foundation of his instruction
was Bach’s “well-tempered clavichord,” that
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of counterpoint and technic. He
first made a reputation in Vienna by his
masterly playing of Bach’s fugues. But the
instruction he had received in composition,
bore fruit also, and some variations to a march
and three sonatas, by him, appeared at this
time in print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>In the account of Beethoven referred to
above, and which was written in 1783, Neefe
said that that young “genius” was deserving
of support that he might be able to travel,
and that he would certainly be another Mozart.
But the development of his genius soon
took a wider scope. He even, on one occasion,
when Neefe was prevented doing so, presided at
a rehearsal in the Bonn theater, in which the
best pieces of the age were produced. This was
at the age of twelve. And so it happened that
his artistic views and technic skill grew steadily
greater. We are told that when he became
court organist, at the age of thirteen, he
made the very accurate vocalist Heller lose the
key entirely during the performance of divine
service, by his own bold modulations. True,
the Elector forbade such “strokes of genius”
in the future, but he, no less than his <i>capellmeister</i>
Luchesi, was greatly astonished at the
extraordinary capacity of the young man.</p>

<p>Incidents of this kind may have suggested the
propriety of giving him the instruction appropriate
for a really great master of art; and, indeed,
we find the court organist of Bonn with
Mozart in Vienna, in the spring of 1787.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Beethoven’s appearance was not what would
be called imposing. He was small of stature,
muscular and awkward, with a short snub
nose. When he was introduced to Mozart,
the latter was rather cool in his praise of his
musical performances, considering them pieces
learned by heart simply for purposes of parade.
Beethoven, thereupon requested Mozart
to give him a subject, that he might try his
powers of musical improvisation. Charmed
with the ability displayed in the execution of
the task thus imposed on his young visitor,
Mozart exclaimed: “Mark that young man!
the world will hear of him some day.”
Beethoven, however, received very little instruction
from Mozart, who was so deeply engaged,
just at this time, with the composition
of his <i>Don Giovanni</i>, and so sorely tried by
adverse circumstances, that he played very little
for him, and could give him only a few lessons.
Besides, Beethoven’s mother was now
taken seriously ill, and after a few weeks he
had to return home, where other blows of a
hard fate awaited him. His kind, good mother,
was snatched from him by death, and his
father’s unfortunate weakness for strong drink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
obtained such a mastery over him that he was
deprived of his position shortly after. The
duty of supporting his two younger brothers
was thus imposed on Ludwig, the eldest.</p>

<p>Young Beethoven was thus taught many a
severe lesson early in life, in the hard school
of adversity. But his trials were not without
advantage to him. They gave to his character
that iron texture which upheld him under
the heaviest burthens, nor was his recall to
Bonn a misfortune. He there found the very
advantages which he had gone to seek in the
musical metropolis, Vienna; for Maximilian
Francis, Elector of Cologne, the friend and
patron of Mozart, was one of the noble princes
of the preceding century, who made their
courts the sanctuary of culture and of art.</p>

<p>Maximilian was the youngest son of Maria
Theresa. He had received the careful training,
for which that imperial house was noted,
and he found in Joseph II an example in
every way worthy of imitation. He was as
faithful to his calling as an ecclesiastic as to
his duties as a ruler, and as adverse to what
he looked upon as superstition in the garb of
Christianity, as to the extravagance of his predecessors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
who had left the country in a state
of corruption and destitution. He everywhere
endeavored to bring order out of chaos
and to spread prosperity among his people.
A pure, fresh atmosphere filled the little court
as long as he presided in it. He was still
young, not much over thirty, and a man of
the truest principles. Speaking of him as
“that most humane and best of princes,” a
contemporary writer says: “People had grown
accustomed to think of Cologne as a land of
darkness, but when they came to the Elector’s
court, they quickly changed their mind.”
The members of the orchestra of the court
especially, among whom our young court organist
is to be reckoned, were, we are told,
very intelligent, right thinking men, of elegant
manners and unexceptionable conduct.</p>

<p>The Elector had opened the University in
1776, and established a public reading-room,
which he visited with no more ostentation
than any one else. “All these institutions, as
I looked upon it, had sworn allegiance to an
unknown genius of humanity, and, for the
first time in my life, my mind had a glimmer
of the meaning and majesty of science,” writes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the painter, Gerhard Kuegelgen, and how could
Beethoven have thought differently? He had,
it is true, devoted himself so exclusively to
music that he had made very little progress in
anything else. In the use of figures he always
found great difficulty, and his spelling was
worse than could be easily tolerated even in
his own day, when orthography was a rather
rare accomplishment. He had studied a little
French and Latin. But the breezes of a higher
intellectual culture which, at this time, swept
through Bonn and influenced him likewise
through his intimate intercourse with the most
highly cultivated people of the city, soon lifted
him to heights unattained by other artists
and musicians of his century—heights from
which he continually discerned new fields of
action. As a consequence of this intercourse
with the learned, he acquired intellectual tastes
in various directions, and so seriously occupied
himself with things intellectual that they became
a necessity to his nature. He tells us
himself that, without laying the least claim to
real learning, it had been his endeavor from
childhood to acquaint himself with what was
best and wisest in every age. But these intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
leanings did not prevent him from being,
as the painter Kuegelgen said of himself,
lovingly devoted to his art. And his own
beloved art of music was, at this very time, cultivated
in Bonn with a greater earnestness and
devotion than any other.</p>

<p>The writer referred to above, speaking of
the Elector, says: “Not only did he play himself,
but he was an enthusiastic lover of music.
It seemed as if he could never tire of hearing
it. Whenever he went to a concert, he was
the most attentive person in the whole audience.”
And no wonder; for the musical instruction
given to the children of Maria
Theresa was excellent. Indeed, the art of music
in Vienna was at that time at its height.
That city was the scene of the labors of Gluck,
Haydn and Mozart. And so there was only
good music to be heard in the “cabinet” at
Bonn. Our Beethoven, now a distinguished
pianist, contributed his share to this; and
we need not be surprised to find him employed
by a prince who knew Mozart and loved him.</p>

<p>But it was not musicians alone who were
benefited by prince’s patronage. No sooner
did the condition of the country leave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the necessary leisure, and the state of its
finances afford him the necessary means, than
he turned his best attention to the theater and
the orchestra. As far back as 1784, Maximilian
Francis had organized an orchestra, and
our young court organist took a place in it as
a player of the tenor violin. The violinist,
Ries, and Simrock, a performer on the French
horn, were also members of it. Ries and
Simrock had henceforth much to do with
Mozart. The following year, a troupe visited
Bonn, and gave Italian operas, French vaudevilles,
as well as Gluck’s <i>Alceste and Orpheus</i>.
They were followed by Grossmann, a person
of rare intellect, and one who holds a distinguished
place in the history of German
dramatic art. His repertory included the
plays of Shakespeare, Lessing, Schiller and
Goethe, with all of whom Beethoven thus became
acquainted early in life. In 1788, Maximilian
Francis established a national theater,
and, dating from this, dramatic poetry and
music began to flourish in Bonn, so that it
took its place, in this respect, side by side with
Mannheim, Vienna and Weimar, and became
a school well calculated to foster the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
abilities of Beethoven. In the orchestra we
find such men as Andreas, Bernhard Romberg
and Anton Reicher, afterwards so celebrated as
a writer on the theory of music. The latter
was, at this time, Beethoven’s most intimate
friend and companion in art. Actors, too, come
upon the stage, many of whom subsequently
filled all Germany with their fame. Dramatic
works of every description appeared. There was
Martin’s <i>Tree of Diana</i>, Mozart’s <i>Elopement
from the Seraglio</i>, Salieri’s <i>Grotto of Trophonius</i>,
Dittersdorf’s <i>Doctor and Apothecary</i>,
and <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, Gluck’s <i>Pilgrim
of Mecca</i>, besides Paisiello’s <i>King Theodore</i>,
and greatest of all, <i>Don Giovanni</i>. The music
“pleased connoisseurs;” and <i>Figaro’s Marriage</i>
greatly charmed both singers and the members
of the orchestra, who vied with one another
to do justice to that beautiful opera.
“The strength of our theater,” says a writer
of the time, characteristically and simply,
“lay in our opera.”</p>

<p>This continual contemplation of “characters
in tone” played a decided part in the
development of an artist who was destined to
infuse into instrumental music so much of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
poetical and even of dramatic life. We are
informed that Beethoven’s power of delineating
character in the language of music was so
great, even at this time, that when improvising,
which he was very fond of doing, he was
frequently asked “to describe the character of
some well-known person.” One distinguishing
peculiarity of the Bonn orchestra had a
marked influence in the development of the
great symphonist of the future, Beethoven.
We refer to what has been called “the accurate
observation of musical light and shade, or
of the <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i>.” This musical peculiarity
was introduced into the Bonn orchestra
by a former <i>capellmeister</i>, Mattioli, “a man
full of fire and refined feeling,” who had
learned orchestral accentuation and declamation
from Gluck, and whose musical enthusiasm
caused him to be considered the superior
of Cannabich of Mannheim, who played such
a part in Mozart’s life, and who had originated
this mode of musical delivery in Germany.
He was succeeded by Joseph Reicha, under
whose energetic leadership the Bonn orchestra
reached its highest point of perfection. In
the autumn of 1791, we find that entire orchestra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
in Mergentheim, the seat of the German
order of which Maximilian Francis was
Grand Master; and we have an account of it
from Mergentheim which gives us a very clear
idea of Beethoven’s life as a student.</p>

<p>Our informant tells us, in the first place,
that he was very much impressed by an octet
of wind instruments. All eight players were,
he says, masters who had reached a high degree
of truth and perfection, especially in the
sustaining of tones. Does not this remind one
of Beethoven’s exquisite septet op. 20? How
Ries infused life and spirit into all by his sure
and vigorous bowing in the orchestra! What
once could be heard only in Mannheim, we
are told, was now heard here—the close observance
of the <i>piano</i> and the <i>forte</i> and the
<i>rinforzando</i>, the swell and gradual growth of
tone, followed by the dropping of the same
from the utmost intensity to the merest breath.
Bernhard Romberg’s playing is lauded for
“perfection of expression and its fine shades
of feeling which appeal to the heart;” his
cousin Andreas’s for “taste in delivery,” and
the true art of his “musical painting.” Can
we wonder that Beethoven’s emulation of, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
struggling for the mastery with such men
contributed constantly to develop his genius?
He is praised for the peculiar expression of
his playing, and above all for the speaking,
significant, expressive character of his fancy.
Our informant says, in closing his account: “I
found him wanting in nothing which goes to
make the great artist. All the superior performers
of this orchestra are his admirers.
They are all ears when he plays, but the man
himself is exceedingly modest and without
pretension of any kind.”</p>

<p>We have now seen what was Beethoven’s
technical training both by practice and example,
on the organ and the piano, in the theater
and the orchestra, and how all these were
to him a school of musical composition; for
the Bonn orchestra was as conversant with
Mozart and Haydn as we of to-day are with
Beethoven. How thoroughly he comprehended
and appreciated Mozart especially, is attested
by what he once said to John Cramer,
the only piano player to whom Beethoven himself
applied terms of high praise. The two
were walking, in 1799, in the park in Vienna,
listening to Mozart’s concert in C minor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
“Cramer! Cramer!” Beethoven exclaimed,
when he heard the simple and beautiful theme
near the close: “We shall never be able to accomplish
anything like that.” “What a modest
man!” was the reply. This leads us to
say something of the few beautiful, purely
human gifts which were the fruit Beethoven
enjoyed through life, of his youth in Bonn.</p>

<p>In Bonn, lived Madame von Breuning, with
her four children, who were only a little
younger than our court organist. Beethoven
and one of the sons, Stephan, received instruction
in music from Ries, and were thus thrown
together. But it was not long before our
young artist himself was called upon to teach
the piano in the family of Madame von
Breuning. How lonely Beethoven felt after his
good mother had succumbed to her many sufferings
and sorrows, we learn from the first
letter of his that has come down to us. We
there read: “She was so good and amiable a
mother to me! She was my best friend. O,
who was happier than I while I could yet
pronounce the sweet name of mother! There
was once some one to hear me when I said
‘mother!’ But to whom can I address that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
name now? Only to the silent pictures of
her which my fancy paints.” But Madame
von Breuning became a second mother to him;
and what her home was, we are informed by
Doctor Wegeler, afterwards husband of
Madame von Breuning’s daughter Eleonore,
for a time one of Beethoven’s pupils. He
writes: “Her home was pervaded by an
atmosphere of unconstrained refinement, spite
of an occasional outburst of the petulance of
youth. The boy, Christoph, took very early
to the writing of little poems. Stephan did the
same thing at a much later date, and successfully.
The useful and agreeable were found combined
in the little social entertainments of
family friends. It was not long before
Beethoven was treated as one of the children.
He spent the greater part of the day in Madame
Bruening’s home, and not unfrequently, the
night. He felt at home in the family, and everything
about him contributed to cheer him and
to develop his mind.” When it is known, on
the authority of the same Doctor Wegeler,
that it was at Madame von Breuning’s home
that Beethoven first became acquainted with
German literature, that there he received his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
first lessons in social etiquette, it is easy to estimate
the value to him of the friendship of
the Breuning family—a friendship which was
never interrupted for a moment during his
long life.</p>

<p>It was while in the enjoyment of this intercourse
with the Breuning family that he felt
the first, charming intimations of the tender
passion. Wegeler makes mention of two
young ladies, one of whom, a pretty, cheerful
and lively blonde, Jeannette d’Honrath, of
Cologne, was a frequent visitor at the Breuning’s.
She took delight in teasing our young
musician, and playfully addressed him, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Mich heute noch von dir zu trennen,</div>
<div class="verse">Und dieses nicht verhindern koennen,</div>
<div class="verse">Ist zu empfendlich für mein Herz!”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>His favored rival in Jeannette’s affections
was a captain in the Austrian army, by the
name of Greth. His name occurs, in 1823,
in the written conversations of our deaf master.
He was just as much taken with the
sweet and beautiful Miss W. (Westherhold),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
but to no purpose. He called his love for her
a “young Werther’s love,” and, many years
after, he told B. Romberg a great many anecdotes
about it. What he thought of his acquaintance
with the Breuning family and
these two young persons may be inferred from
the words in which he dedicated the variations
<i>Se vuol ballare</i>, to his friend Lorchen (Eleonore
Breuning) in 1793: “May this work,”
he says, “serve to recall the time when I
spent so many and such happy hours in your
home.”</p>

<p>Besides the home of the Breunings, in which
Beethoven was always so welcome, we may
mention another—that of Count Waldstein, to
whom the sonata op. 23 is dedicated. The
count was very friendly to Beethoven. He
was aware of his genius, and, on that account,
afforded him pecuniary assistance. Yet, to
spare the artist’s feelings, this assistance was
made to have the appearance of coming from
the Elector. It may be that it was this same
amiable and art-loving young Austrian who endeavored
to keep Beethoven’s eye fixed on the
one place in the world in which he could receive
the final touch to his musical education,—Vienna.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
The very multitude of Beethoven’s
ideas, and the height to which his intellect
had soared, showed him that he was far from
having reached perfection in the artistic representation
of those ideas. His readiness of execution
and his wonderful power of improvisation,
even now, assured him victory wherever he
went. But the small number of compositions
which he wrote at this time, in Bonn, is sufficient
proof that he did not feel sure of himself
as a composer. And yet he had now reached
an age at which Mozart was celebrated as a
composer of operas.</p>

<p>In March, 1790, Haydn, on his journey to
London, passed through Bonn, and was presented
to the orchestra by Maximilian Francis,
in person. He returned in the summer of
1792, and as Mozart had died in the meantime,
nothing was more natural than that
Beethoven should apply to the greatest living
musician for instruction. The Elector assisted
him; and we may divine how the young musician’s
heart must have swelled, now that he
had entered the real wrestling-place in his
art, from what, as we stated before, he said to
his teacher Neefe: “If I ever become a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
man,” etc. But what was there that is not
expected from such a person? Waldstein
expressed the “realization of his long contested
wishes” by writing in Beethoven’s
album: “By uninterrupted industry, thou
wilt acquire the mind of Mozart from the
hands of Haydn.” When the wars of the
Revolution swept over the boundaries of
France, the excitement produced was great
and universal. Beethoven was affected only
by its ideal side. He was spared the sight of
the grotesque ridiculousness of the <i>sans
culottes</i> and the blood of the guillotine.
After a short journey, in November, 1792,
Vienna afforded him a safe retreat which he
never afterwards left. It was not long before
the French were masters of the Rhine. Maximilian
Francis was obliged to flee, and thus
every prospect of Beethoven’s returning home
was lost.</p>

<p>It now became imperative that he should
take care of himself. His two brothers were
provided for—Karl was a musician and Johann
an apothecary. They soon followed him
to Vienna, where it was not long before they
renewed the scenes of his home life in Bonn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
But his own constant endeavor was to be the
creative artist that, as he became more firmly
convinced every day, he was born to be. His
studies under Haydn, then under Schenk, with
whom the readers of the Life of Mozart are
familiar from his connection with the opera of
the <i>Magic Flute</i>, afterwards under the dry-as-dust
Albrechtsberger, the teacher of counterpoint,
and even under Mozart’s deadly enemy,
Salieri—were earnestly and zealously pursued,
as is evident from what he has left after him.
But even now his mind was too richly developed
and his fancy too lofty to learn anything
except by independent action. Ten of
Beethoven’s works date from the time he lived
in Bonn; but, during his first sojourn in
Vienna, compositions flowed in profusion from
his pen, and we cannot but suppose that the
germs of many of these last were sown during
the period of his virtuosoship in Bonn. We
conclude this chapter with a list of the works
here referred to.</p>

<p>Besides his first attempts at musical composition
already mentioned, a concerto for the
piano written in 1784, and three quartets for
the piano written in 1785, which were afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
made use of in the sonatas op. 2, we
must add, as certainly dating from this period
of Beethoven’s life in Bonn, a ballet by Count
Waldstein (1791), a trio for the piano in E
flat, the eight songs of op. 52, which appeared
in 1805, two arias, one of which occurs in this
op. as Goethe’s <i>Mailied</i>, a part of the Bagatellen
op. 33 which appeared in 1803, the two
preludes op. 39, a minuet published in 1803,
the variations <i>Vieni Amore</i> (1790), a funeral
cantata on the death of Joseph II. (1790), and
one on that of Leopold II. (1792), the last of
which was submitted to Haydn and which he
thought a great deal of—both of these latter
compositions are lost—an allegro and minuet
for two flutes, a rondino for reed instruments
and the string trio op. 3 which appeared in
1796.</p>

<p>In addition to these, there are, in all probability,
many other compositions which were
completed during Beethoven’s first sojourn in
Vienna, and published at a still later date; the
octet op. 103, after which the quintet op.
4 was patterned before 1797, the serenade op.
8, which contained the germ of his nocturne
op. 42; the Variations op. 66, on <i>Ein Maedchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
oder Weibchen</i>, from the <i>Magic Flute</i>
(published in 1798); the variations on <i>God
Save the King</i>, the Romance for the violin, both
of which appeared in 1805, when Beethoven’s
brother secretly published much of his music;
the variation on <i>Se vuol ballare</i> from Mozart’s
<i>Figaro</i>; the <i>Es War Einmal</i> from Dittersdroff’s
<i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, the “See He
Comes,” the Messias, and a theme by Count
Waldstein (appeared 1793, 1797), the <i>Easy
Sonata</i> in C major, dedicated to Eleonore von
Breuning; the prelude in F minor (appeared
in 1805), and the sextet for wind instruments,
op. 71, which appeared in 1810.</p>

<p>In his twenty-third year, Mozart could point
to three hundred works which he had composed,
among them the poetical sonatas of his
youth. How little of sunshine and leisure
must there have been in a life which, spite of
its extraordinary intellectual wealth and activity,
reaped so little fruit! And even if we
fix the date when the three trios op. 1, were
composed in this period, when Beethoven was
for the first time taught the meaning of the
world and history, by the stormy movements
of the last decade of the last century; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
admit that the two concertos for the piano
(op. 19 and op. 15) owe their origin to the
wonderful fantasias with which he charmed
the hearts and minds of the people of Bonn
at that time, yet how little did he achieve!
This fact is the most convincing proof of the
truth of Beethoven’s own assertion, that fortune
did not favor him in Bonn. Leaving
his musical training out of consideration,
Beethoven’s youth was not a very happy one.
Seldom was it brightened for any length of
time by the smiles of joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> golden age of music in Vienna had not
passed away when Beethoven came to that
city. Not the court, but the wealthy nobility,
and a great many circles of the cultured found
in music the very soul of their intellectual life
and of a nobler existence. A consequence of
this was that more attention was paid to chamber
music than any other; and we accordingly
find that the greater number of Beethoven’s
compositions, written at this period, are of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
style of music. Their very dedications tell us
much of the social circles of Vienna, and of
the persons who graced them.</p>

<p>First of all, we have the three trios op. 1,
dedicated to Prince Karl von Lichnowsky.
The man who had been the pupil and friend
of Mozart might be glad, indeed, to see a substitute
found so soon for that departed genius.
A quartet consisting of the able artists
Schuppanzigh, Sina, Weiss and Kraft, played
at his house every Friday. Dr. Wegeler informs
us that Beethoven, in 1794, lived with
the Prince, who, at a later date, paid him a
salary of twelve hundred marks. The variations
on <i>Seht er Kommt</i>, (See he comes) 1797,
were dedicated to his consort, the Princess
Christiane, <i>nee</i> Thun. She prized Beethoven
very highly, and, as he once said of her himself,
would have liked to encase him in glass,
that he might be screened from the defiling
breath and touch of the unworthy. The first
three sonatas op. 2 are dedicated to J. Haydn,
and they introduce us to his special patron,
the Prince Esterhazy, with whom Beethoven
was not very intimate, although the commission
to write the mass op. 86 was given by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Nicholas Esterhazy. The quartet op. 4, as
well as the sonatas for violin, op. 23 and 24
(1800), and the string quintet op. 29 (1801),
are dedicated to Count Fries. There is much
in Beethoven’s life to show that he was on
terms of close friendship with this rich “merchant.”
The sonata op. 7 (1797), is dedicated
to Countess Keglevics. The first concerto,
which was finished in 1794, is dedicated to the
same person, then known as Princess Odescalchi.
The trios op. 9, as well as the brilliant
sonata op. 22, belong, by right of dedication,
to the Russian Count Browne, whom Beethoven
himself called <i>le premier Mecene de sa muse</i>,
and the sonatas op. 10 (1798), to his consort.
To the Countess von Thun, he dedicated the
trio op. 11, composed the same year, and the
sonatas op. 12, to Salieri, one of his teachers
in Vienna.</p>

<p>How highly Beethoven esteemed Lichnowsky
is evidenced by the dedication to him of
op. 14, the <i>Pathetique</i> (1799). In it we
find the earliest expression of Beethoven’s
view of music as a voice speaking to man’s
innermost nature, calling to him to live a
higher life. To Lichnowsky, likewise, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
dedicated the sonata op. 26 with the beautiful
funeral march (1802). The two lovely sonatas
op. 14 of the year 1799, as well as the sonata
for the horn, op. 17 (1800), are dedicated to
the Countess Braun, whose husband gave
Beethoven, some years after, the commission
for the <i>Fidelio</i>; and the quintet op. 16 which
was finished in 1797 to Prince Schwarzenberg.
When we connect the name of Prince
Lobkowitz with the first quartets op. 18, composed
in 1797-1800; that of Baron von
Swieten the lover of the well-tempered clavichord
with the first symphony op. 21 (1800),
that of the learned von Sonnenfels with the so-called
pastoral sonata op. 28 (1801), we can see
the force of the remark made by J. F.
Reichart, that the Austrian nobility of this
period loved and appreciated music better probably
than any other in the history of the
world. That they did not continue to do so
is due entirely to the fact of the general disturbance
of their pecuniary circumstances consequent
on the wars which came to an end
only in 1815, and which diminished their favorable
influence on the cultivation of the art of
music. But our artist had all the advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of this noble patronage. He spared no pains
nor sacrifice to profit by it. But his mind
could not rest in the mere enjoyment of
music. It sought other and higher spheres.
His art was destined to absorb into itself the
whole world of culture, to take an active part
in the march of history and co-operate in giving
expression to the ideas of life. The first
real exploits of our artist were the <i>Eroica</i> and
the <i>Fidelio</i> with the Leonore overture; but
the path which led to them was one on which
those immediately surrounding him could not
very well follow him, and one which subsequently
isolated him personally more and more
from his fellow men.</p>

<p>It was an ill-defined longing for this starry
path of a higher intellectual existence which
brought him to the north of Germany, to
Berlin, after he had finished the principal
parts of the course in music under Haydn,
Schenk and Albrechtsberger. Not that he
did not meet with recognition and remuneration
in his new home. But, after all, the
recognition and remuneration he met with
there were such as a virtuoso might expect.
For the present, neither the public nor music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
publishers would have much to do with his
compositions. Writing to Schiller’s wife, the
young Bonn professor, Fischenich, says of
him: “So far as my acquaintance with him
goes, he is made for the great and the sublime.
Haydn has said that he would give him great
operas, and soon be compelled himself to stop
composing.” He informs her, at the same
time, that Beethoven was going to set her husband’s
Hymn to Joy—<i>Freude schoener Goetterfunken</i>—to
music. We thus see that he, even
now, harbored those great ideas which engaged
him at the close of his labors, in the composition
of the Ninth Symphony. There were as
yet but few traces to be found in Vienna of
the intellectual awakening to which Germany
is indebted for its earliest classical literature,
and the period of its great thinkers in the west
and the north. On the other hand, Beethoven’s
own mind was too full of the “storm and
stress” to be able to appreciate the beautiful
harmony and the warmth which had made
such phenomena as Haydn and Mozart possible
in South-German Austria. But in the
North, the memory of “old Fritz” still lived;
there the stern rule of mind and conscience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
generated by Protestantism, still prevailed,
while the firm frame-work of his own art, the
counterpoint of the great Bach, the “first
father of harmony,” as he calls him himself,
was there preserved, apparently, in its full
strength. In addition to all this, the court
there was fond of music, and King Frederick
William II had endeavored to keep Mozart,
the greatest master of his time, in Berlin;
while Beethoven, since the Elector’s flight
from Bonn, had no further prospects in his
home on the Rhine. He, therefore, decided
to remove to the North.</p>

<p>We find him on his journey thither at the
beginning of 1796. “My music secures me
friends and regard—what more do I want?”
he writes from Prague to his brother Johann,
who, in the meantime, had entered into the
employment of an apothecary in Vienna. He
here composed the aria <i>Ah Perfido</i> (op. 65).
On his way to Berlin he passed through
Dresden and Leipzig, but of his stay in these
two cities, we have no information. The king
received him very graciously; he played a
few times at court and composed the sonatas
for cello, op. 5, because the king himself played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the violincello. The very first impression received
by Beethoven seems to have been decisive.
K. Czerny, to whom he taught the
piano, tells us something from his own recollection
and observation about him, which is
very characteristic of the man, and shows how
sorely disappointed he felt in his most ardent
expectations in Berlin. He says: “His improvisation
was very brilliant, astonishing in
the highest degree.... No matter in what
society he was thrown, he made such an impression
on all his hearers that it frequently
happened that not a dry eye was to be seen,
while many broke into sobs. There was something
wonderful in his expression, besides the
beauty and originality of his ideas, and the
highly intellectual way he had of presenting
them. When he had finished an improvisation
of this kind he could break out into a fit
of loud laughter and ridicule his hearers on the
emotions he had excited. At times he even felt
injured by those signs of sympathy. ‘Who,’
he asked, ‘can live among such spoiled children?’
and for that reason alone he once declined
an invitation extended to him by the
king of Prussia, after an improvisation of this
kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Beethoven was doomed to a disappointment
of a very peculiar kind here. Instead of the
manliness of character which he, coming from
the softer South, expected to find in the North,
he was confronted with a voluptuous luxury
to which his art was only a handmaid, and
with an apparent surfeit of music, the natural
outgrowth of the French influence due to Voltaire’s
residence in Berlin. Such was not the
spirit of the new era which animated himself,
and for the operation of which he was seeking a
proper theater of action. The king himself
did all in his power to make Gluck and
Mozart settle in Berlin, and Handel’s oratorios
were played even at the court concerts. But
how could a man like Beethoven have worked
side by side with the ruling leaders in music—with
a Himmel and a Rhigini? The only person
in Berlin who seemed to Beethoven a man,
in the full sense of the word, was Prince Louis
Ferdinand. With genuine frankness, he remarked
of the prince’s playing that “it was
not kingly or princely, but only that of a good
piano player.” But it is probable that from
the prince he borrowed the chivalric and, at
the same time, poetico-enthusiastic character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
found in his third concerto (op. 37), which was
finished in 1800 and dedicated to the prince,
“the most human of human beings.”</p>

<p>He played twice in the Singing Academy
before its conductor, Fasch, and his successor,
Zelter, Goethe’s well-known friend, when he
again brought the tears to the eyes of his
hearers. But he clearly saw from the example
of these two principal representatives of
the more serious taste for music in Berlin, that
it was not Bach’s spirit which he was in search
of that ruled there, but only a caricature of
it; and this last was by no means a counterpoise
to the Italian style of music, which still
held absolute sway. He returned to Vienna
disappointed in every respect, but with all the
greater confidence in himself. He never again
left Austria for good. It became the scene of
his grandest achievements, and it was not long
before their history began.</p>

<p>In a small memorandum book used by
Beethoven on his journey from Bonn to
Vienna, we find the following passage: “Take
courage. Spite of all physical weakness, my
mind shall rule. I have reached my twenty-fifth
year, and must now be all that I can be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Nothing must be left undone.” The father
always represented Beethoven to be younger
than he really was. Even in 1810, the son
would not admit that he was forty years of age.
The words quoted above must, therefore, have
been written in the winter of 1796 or 1797;
and this fact invests them with a greater significance
than they would otherwise possess;
for our artist now saw that, without the shadow
of a doubt, Austria and Vienna were to be his
abiding places; and he, therefore, strained
every nerve, regardless of what the consequences
might be, “to be a great man sometime;”
that is, to accomplish something really good in
music. This regardlessness of consequences
manifested itself especially in the little care he
seemed to take of his physical well-being. A
friend, who had every opportunity to observe
him, Baron von Zmeskall, informs us that
“in the summer of 1796, he came home
almost overpowered by the heat, tore open the
doors and windows of the house, took off his
coat and vest and seated himself at an open
window to cool himself. The consequence of
his imprudence was a dangerous illness, which
ultimately settled on the organs of hearing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
From this time his deafness kept on increasing.”
It is possible that the first symptoms
of his deafness did not appear as early as
1796; but certain it is, that it dates back into
the last decade of the last century, that it was
brought about by heedlessness of his health, and
that it became a severe tax on his moral courage.
His genius was so absorbed in his music,
that he too frequently forgot to take care of the
physical man. In November, 1796, Stephan
von Breuning remarked of him, that “his
travels had contributed to mature his character;
that he was a better judge of men, and
had learned to appreciate the value, but, at the
same time, the rarity of good friends.” The
hard trials of life had added to the earnestness
of his disposition, and he was awakening to a
full sense of what his own duty in this world
was. This leads us to the first great and memorable
work of his genius—to the <i>Eroica</i>, followed
soon after by the symphony in C minor.</p>

<p>When, in the year 1806, one of his friends
informed Beethoven of Napoleon’s victory at
Jena, he exclaimed: “It’s a pity that I do not
understand the art of war as well as I do the
art of music. If I did I certainly would conquer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
him.” These words express a rivalry
almost personal in its nature, and could have
been spoken only by a fool or by a man of
power not unlike that of Napoleon himself.
And, indeed, leaving out of consideration men
of genius like Goethe and Schiller, whose
fame had been long established on a firm
foundation, there were among his contemporaries
men of sovereign ambition, only one
person, Napoleon Bonaparte, able to make any
great impression on a man who had chosen
for his motto: “Power is the moral code of
men who distinguish themselves above others;
and it is mine, too.” A series of the most
brilliant victories was achieved up to 1798 by
the General of the glorious French Republic,
who was of the same age as Beethoven. General
Bernadotte, whose descendants occupy the
throne of Sweden in our day, had participated
in those victories. Bernadotte was the French
Ambassador to Vienna in the beginning of
1798. He was young; by his origin he belonged
to the middle class; he was the representative
of the Republic, and could, therefore, indulge,
unconstrained, in personal intercourse
with whomsoever he pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The celebrated violinist, Rudolph Kreutzer,
to whom Beethoven’s <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> (op.
47) is dedicated, was one of his retinue. It
was very natural that once Bernadotte and
Kreutzer became acquainted with Beethoven,
their intercourse with him and their friendship
for him, should have been more than
usually intimate. Bernadotte, who was sincerely
devoted to Napoleon, and who must
have felt himself drawn still more closely to
Beethoven, because of his enthusiasm for the
general, suggested to him the idea of celebrating
the exploits of his hero by a symphony.
Beethoven so informed his amanuensis, Schindler,
in 1823, and his account is corroborated
by other facts, that such was the first impulse
to the composition of the <i>Eroica</i>.</p>

<p>But the advocate of power was destined soon
to swell to the proportions of the hero of intellectual
courage. “For thus does fate knock
at the gates.” Beethoven used these words in
1823, in speaking “with uncontrollable enthusiasm”
of that wonderful <i>motive</i> at the
opening of the symphony in C minor. The
last movement of the work, the fanfare-like
<i>finale</i>, so expressive of the joy of victory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
shows that he here described a victory indeed,
the surmounting of the obstacles and darkness
of life, even if those obstacles and that darkness
consisted only of “the infirmities of the
body.” The sketches of this movement, however,
occur in the draft of the quartet op. 18,
and hence must have been noted down before
the year 1800! But the fact that the melody
of the <i>adagio</i> was also found in that sketch
shows that he was even then as certain of
mastering sorrow, as he was conscious of the
presence of the “demon in his ears,” and of
the sad prospect of a “wretched” and lonely
future—a prospect which stirred him to the
very depths of his soul.</p>

<p>But it was years before these <i>motives</i> took
shape in his mind. To do justice to the great
ideas to which they give expression, to the
heroic victory of power and will over whatever
opposes them, he had to concentrate and
strengthen all his powers of mind and heart,
and to develop his talents by long exercise.
The portraiture of the struggles and of the
artistic creations of the next succeeding years
constitutes the transition to those first great
heroic deeds—a transition which must be understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
by all who would understand Beethoven’s
music.</p>

<p>The Napoleonic way in which Beethoven,
at the close of the last century, outgeneraled
all the most celebrated virtuosos of the time in
Vienna and in Europe, is attested by his triumph
over the renowned pianist Woelffl, in
1799, and his defeat of Steibelt, in 1800. But
he did still more towards achieving success by
his works. His numerous variations won over
to him many a fair player of the piano, while
his <i>Adelaide</i>, which appeared in 1797, gained
for him the hearts of all persons of fine feeling;
so that Wegeler may have told the simple
truth, when he wrote: “Beethoven was never,
at least so long as I lived in Vienna (1794-96),
without a love affair; and he occasionally made
a conquest which it would have been very hard,
if not impossible, for many a handsome Adonis
to have made.” The “ugly,” pock-marked
man, with the piercing eyes, was possessed
of a power and beauty more attractive than
any mere physical charms. And then, there
was the charm of his sonatas: op. 7, with the
funeral song in <i>adagio</i>, which he is said to
have written in a tempest of “passionate feeling”;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of op. 10, with its genuine masculine
profile; of the revolutionary sonata in C minor,
with the mysterious struggle in the <i>allegretto</i>
in No. II., and the brilliant exultation of victory
in the <i>allegro</i> in No. III., the tragic song of
the <i>largo</i>, the gentle grace of the minuet—here
used exceptionally in the place of the <i>scherzo</i>,
as we find it already in op. 1; and, last of all,
the droll question of little Snub Nose, in the
<i>finale</i>. And yet these were followed by the
<i>Pathetique</i>, with its exquisite and enrapturing
<i>adagio</i>, and the two beautiful love songs, op.
14; by the six quartets, op. 18, in which he
offered to a society of friends of his art, true
songs of the soul and pictures of life overflowing;
by the <i>adagio</i> of No. I, another Romeo-and-Juliet
grave scene; by the <i>adagio</i> of No.
VI., descriptive of the melancholy which, even
now, began to gather its dark clouds about
Beethoven himself, whose breast was so well
attuned to joy. The descriptive septet (op.
20, 1800,) and the first symphony (op. 21),
sketched after the style of Haydn, but painted
with Mozart’s pencil, are the last scenes in
what we may call Beethoven’s older life, which
closed with the eighteenth century. The beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of the nineteenth opened a new world
to our artist.</p>

<p>The new world thus opened to Beethoven,
and the manner in which he himself conceived
it, may be best described in Schiller’s magnificent
verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wie schön, O Mensch, mit deinem Palmenzweige</div>
<div class="verse">Stehst du an des Jahrhunderts Neige,</div>
<div class="verse">In edler stolzer Männlichkeit!</div>
<div class="verse">Mit aufgeschlossnem Sinn, mit Geistesfülle,</div>
<div class="verse">Voll milden Ernsts, in thatenreicher Stille,</div>
<div class="verse">Der reifste Sohn der Zeit.</div>
<div class="verse">Frei durch Vernunft, stark durch Gesetze,</div>
<div class="verse">Durch Sanftmuth gross und reich durch Schätze,</div>
<div class="verse">Die lange Zeit dein Busen dir verschwieg.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And now began for Beethoven a period of
severe trials, brought upon him by himself.
Absorbed in work, he neglected to take sufficient
care of his physical health. His trouble
with his hearing was increasing, but he paid no
attention to it. His carelessness in this regard
reduced him to a condition in which he
would have found no alleviation and no joy,
were it not for the inexhaustible resources he
possessed within himself.</p>

<p>But to understand him fully, we must read
what he wrote himself, in June, 1801, to the
“best of human kind,” his friend Amenda, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Kurland, who had left Vienna two years before.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your own dear Beethoven is very unhappy. He
is in conflict with nature and with God. Many and
many a time have I cursed Him because He has made
His creatures the victims of the smallest accidents in
nature, and this to such an extent that what promises
to be best and most beautiful in life, is destroyed.
You must know that what was most precious to me,
my hearing, has been, in great part, lost. How sad
my life is! All that was dear to me, all that I loved
is gone! How happy would I now be, if I could only
hear as I used to hear! If I could, I would fly to
thee; but as it is, I must stay away. My best years
will fly, and I shall not have fulfilled the promise of
my youth, nor accomplish in my art what I fondly
hoped I would. I must now take refuge in the sadness
of resignation.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have here the words to the long-drawn
funereal tones of a song as we find it at the
beginning of the celebrated C sharp minor
(<i>Mondschein</i>) sonata op. 27 No. II, which
belongs to this period. The direct incentive
to its composition was Seume’s poem, <i>die Beterin</i>
in which he gives us a description of a
daughter praying for her noble father, who has
been condemned to death. But in this painful
struggle with self, we also hear the storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of passion, in words as well as in tones. Beethoven’s
life at this time was one of sorrow.
He writes: “I can say that I am living a
miserable life. I have more than once execrated
my existence. But if possible I shall
bid defiance to fate, although there will be, I
know, moments in my life when I shall be
God’s most unhappy creature.” The thunders
of power may be heard in the <i>finale</i> of
that sonata. When it was published, the following
year, its dedication ran: <i>Alla damigella
contessa Giulietta Guicciardi</i>. The
celebrated Giulietta! Her friendship was,
indeed, a cheering ray of sunshine in Beethoven’s
“wretched life” at this time. As he
writes himself in the fall of the year 1801:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My life is somewhat pleasanter now. I move about
among men more than I used to. I am indebted for
this change for the better to a lovely, charming girl
who loves me and is loved by me. For two years now
I have had once more some moments of happiness, and
for the first time in my life I feel that marriage might
make one happy. Unfortunately, she does not belong
to my social circle. But if I cannot get married at
the present time, I shall have to mix more among
men.”</p>
</div>

<p>The family of the imperial counsellor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Count Guicciardi, originally from Modena,
was one of the families of the higher class with
whom Beethoven had formed an intimate acquaintance
through his art. Guicciardi’s wife
belonged to the Hungarian family of the
Brunswicks, who were likewise very friendly
to Beethoven. We shall yet have something
to say of the Countess Theresa Brunswick, for
whom and whose sister, the charming Countess
Deym, the variations for four hands on <i>Ich
denke dein</i>, were written in 1800. Countess
Giulietta was in her sixteenth year, and as
good as betrothed to Count Gallenberg, a
musician and composer of ballet music. He
was, however, in such pecuniary straits that
Beethoven had, on one occasion, to come to
his assistance through a friend. The young
girl did not give any serious thought to a
union with the Count, although he belonged
to her own social circle. The attractions of
a genuine love had more charms for her. This
same true, genuine love possessed Beethoven’s
soul. He writes to his friend Wegeler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I feel that my youth is only now beginning. Was
I not always a sickly man? But, for a time, my physical
strength has been increasing more than ever before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and the same is true of my mental power. With
every succeeding day I approach nearer to the goal
which I feel, but cannot describe. Thus only can I
live. No rest! I know of no repose but sleep, and it
sorely pains me that I have now to allot more time to
sleep than was once necessary. Let me be only half
freed from my trouble and then, a perfectly mature
man, I shall come to you and renew our old friendship.
You must see me as happy as it is given me to be
here below. You must not see me unhappy; that is
more than I could bear. I shall struggle manfully
with fate, and be sure, it will not overcome me entirely.
O, how beautiful it would be to live life over a
thousand times! But I am not made for a quiet life.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this, Beethoven’s elasticity of soul, which
lifted him to the height of joy and of intellectual
delight, we are indebted for those works
of his which are models of poetic creation.
What became of the traditional form of the
sonata after Beethoven began to tell in song
the meaning of joy and pain and of their
wonderful admixture, as he did in the sonata
op. 31, No. II, the first movement of which
looks as if thrown off with a single stroke of
the pen? There are the thoughtful questionings
of fate in the opening chord; the
jubilant, tempestuous enjoyment of pleasure;
the expression of woe, more terrible in anticipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
than realization, when misery
wrings a cry of pain from him, and he breaks
out in recitative—a form of art never before
coupled with an instrument, but which is here
more eloquent than words. Sorrow, joy and
genius have now transformed the mere
musician into the artist and the poet. Beethoven,
as the master of the intellectual
world of tones, began his career with this
sonata in D minor. From this time forward,
his every piece is a psychological picture
of life. The form of the sonata had now
fully developed the intellectual germ which in
it lay. It is no longer mere form, but a finite
vessel holding an infinite intellectual treasure
as its contents. Even the separate parts of it,
although retained as usual, are henceforth
only phases and stages of the development of
that intellectual treasure. They are acts of a
drama played in the recesses of a human soul—in
the soul of a man who is forced to taste,
while still he laughs in his melancholy, the
tragic contents of the cup of human life during
every moment of his existence. For thus
it was now with Beethoven. The deepest sorrow
endows him with untrammeled serenity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of mind. Darkness becomes to him the parent
of a higher light. A humor that weeps
through its smiles is henceforth his.</p>

<p>On this sonata followed a symphony with
the real Beethoven flavor, the second symphony
(op. 36). It had its origin in the
“sublime feeling” which “animated” him in
the beautiful summer days of 1802; as had
also the brilliant <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> (op. 47).
This summer of 1802 is a memorable one in
Beethoven’s life. It brought with it the
severest trials of his courage as a man. These
trials transformed him into a hero, and were
the incentives to the composition of the <i>Eroica</i>.
To this period belongs the so-called “Heiligenstadt
Will,” which discloses to us the inmost
depths of Beethoven’s soul.</p>

<p>His physician had ordered him in October,
1802, to the village of Heiligenstadt, near
Vienna, in a condition of the utmost hopelessness.
Beethoven thought that death was not
far off, and, anxious to justify himself before
posterity, he wrote from that place: “O, you
men, who think or say that I am malignant,
obstinate or misanthropic, what an injustice
you do me! You know not the secret cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
what you think you see. From childhood up,
my heart and mind have been bent upon the
accomplishment of great deeds; I was ever
moved thereto by the feeling of benevolence.
To accomplish such deeds I was always disposed.
But consider that for six—yes, six
whole years, I have been in a most unfortunate
condition—a condition which has been made
worse by the stupidity of my physicians; that
my hopes, from year to year, of being cured
have been disappointed, and that at last there
lies before me the prospect of permanent ill.
Born with an active and even fiery temperament,
a lover of the distractions of society, I
had to live in a state of isolation from all men.
How humbled I felt when a person standing
near me could hear a flute that was playing in
the distance, while I could hear nothing!
Experiences like this brought me to the very
verge of despair, and I came very near ending
my own life. Art alone held me back. It
seemed to me impossible that I should leave
the world until I had accomplished all for
which I felt myself so well fitted. O God,
thou seest my heart. Thou seest that it harbors
beneficence and love for human kind. O<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
you men, when you read this, remember that
you have wronged me, and let the unfortunate
rejoice to find one of their number who, spite
of the obstacles put in his way by nature, did
all in his power to be admitted into the ranks
of artists and men worthy of the name.”</p>

<p>And now, too, we find in his music the
first traces of such appeals to the Godhead. The
text of the six songs of Gellert, op. 48, which
appeared in 1803, are of a religious nature.
But, in the domain of religion, our artist had
not yet risen to his full height. He is still preponderantly
the musician of life, force and of
the brilliant play of the intellect; and his compositions
are still pre-eminently works of art
and of the fancy. The <i>Eroica</i> (op. 55), which
was finished in 1803, possessed these characteristics
in the highest sense of the word. And now
we may understand what he felt himself, as he
said in his “Will,” fitted to accomplish, as
well as the mysterious conversation he had in
1823, with his amanuensis, Schindler, in which
he speaks of this period of his life, and of
Giulietta, who had now long been the Countess
Gallenberg, and who had, a short time before,
returned from Naples, where her husband had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
acted as director of the theater for years.
The conversation in question begins thus: It
was held in the French language—</p>

<p>Beethoven—“She was mine before she was
her husband’s or Italy’s, and she paid me a
visit, bathed in tears; but I despised her.”</p>

<p>Schindler—“By Hercules!”</p>

<p>Beethoven—“If I had parted in that way
with my strength, as well as my life, what
would have remained to me for nobler and better
things?”</p>

<p>Beethoven had said of himself that he
had something to do in the world besides marrying.
His ideal was not to live in such
cramped circumstances. He knew of “nobler
and better things.” Yet it seems that he offered
his hand to the “lovely, charming girl”
in this year 1803, when he began to have a
prospect of permanently bettering his condition,
and that Giulietta was not disinclined to
marry him. But family considerations prevented
the decisive step; and she was married
in the fall of the same year to Count Gallenberg.
“Despising” her—whether rightly or
wrongly we have no means of determining,
but we do know that she was not happy—Beethoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
turned to the performance of the
great tasks for which he felt himself fitted.</p>

<p>Our artist’s life, like that of a thousand
others, thus proves the truth of the old saying:
the course of true love never did run smooth.
In his earlier biographies this episode has been
treated as a great and even tragic event, because
that remarkable letter to his “immortal
love,” of which we shall yet have occasion to
speak, was erroneously supposed to be addressed
to Countess Guicciardi and to refer to
this circumstance in his life. But although
no more than an episode, Beethoven could
here have mastered his feelings only by the
full consciousness he now possessed of the duty
he owed to his genius. As Liszt says, <i>le genie
oblige</i>, and Beethoven felt that it was a duty
genius owed to mankind to sacrifice mere ambition
and even the heartfelt happiness that is
born of love. The day before Guilietta’s
wedding, he wrote to Macco, the painter:
“You paint, and I shall compose music. In
this way, we shall be immortal; yes, perhaps
live forever.” And that our artist had some
right to lay claim to such immortality is
proved not only by his sonatas, which are little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
poems in themselves, by his songs and quartets,
but by mighty and memorable works which
reflect the world-soul. He was working on
that grand creation, the <i>Eroica</i>. This sacrifice
of his feelings may have been, and most
likely was, forced upon him by the accident
of the uncertainty of his position in life, but
that it was not made without a struggle is
manifest from his expression of contempt for
Giulietta—<i>mais je la méprisais</i> but still more
from the ideal of the value of faithful love
which now became rooted in his soul, and
which we see reflected in the <i>Fidelio</i>, that
immediately followed the <i>Eroica</i>, and which
presents us with the most beautiful of all
female characters. In its composition, we find
united that warmth of heart and that intellectual
in sight so peculiarly Beethoven’s own, and
which he so beautifully embodied in his art.
On the golden background of his enthusiasm
for “nobler and better things,” the sweet face
of Leonore stands out in bold relief as the
perfect type of human beauty.</p>

<p>Beethoven borrowed the tones of the <i>Eroica</i>
from the elevating nature of humanitarian
ideas transferred to the region of public life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The hero enters, touching with giant hands
the foundations of human existence, which he
wants to ameliorate by renewing them. And,
indeed, the First Consul of the French Republic
might very well suggest to him, at the beginning
of this century, how heroes act, the
jubilation with which nations greet them,
how great existing institutions oppose their
progress, and, finally, overthrow them in their
might. The first movement of the <i>Eroica</i> describes
the most varied events in the life of
such a hero with a fullness of episode almost
destructive of its form. In its climax, the real
work of the hero is seen; the old order of
things is heard crumbling and falling to pieces
in its powerful and terrific syncopations and
dissonant chords, to make place for a new existence,
one more worthy of human beings.
But, at the close of the movement, the victorious
hero exultingly yokes the new order of
things to his chariot. This is history, the
world’s history in tones; and, for its sake, we
may for the moment shroud the dearest longings
of the heart in the dark robes of resignation.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s fancy as an artist fully comprehended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the genius of liberty, at this time
newly born into the world, and a new factor
in the history of mankind. He understood,
too, the tragic fate of all heroes—that they are
destined, like all other mortals, to fall, and,
though God-commissioned, to die, that their
works may live and prosper. Bonaparte’s
history also suggested the rhythm of the sublime
and solemn step of the funeral march;
for, since the days of Cæsar and Alexander,
no man had stepped as did he through the
spaces of the existing order of things. But
Beethoven’s poetic fancy soared even now far
beyond the reality that surrounded him. As
early as 1802, he wrote to the music dealers in
Leipzig, now so well known as the publishers
of the <i>Edition Peters</i>: “Away with you all,
gentlemen! To propose to me to write such a
sonata! That might have done in the time
when the Revolution was at fever heat, but now
that everything has returned to the old beaten
path, that Bonaparte has concluded a concordat
with the Pope, to write such a sonata—away
with you!” It is not Napoleon, therefore, who
is here interred. It is not Napoleon for whom
mankind weeps in the tones of this funeral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
march. It is the ever-living, ever-awakening
hero of humanity, the genius of our race, that
is solemnly borne to the grave to the rhythm of
this wonderful march—a march which has in
it something of the tragic pathos of a Shakespeare
or an Æschylus. Beethoven in this
march became a tragic writer of purely instrumental
music, and gave evidence of that quality
of soul which made him indifferent to “the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”</p>

<p>The two last movements of the work do not
convey so powerful an idea of heroic action.
Was it that his powers of imagination flagged,
or that the change in Napoleon’s career made
him disgusted with the hero? We know that
when, in the spring of 1804, the copy of the
symphony was finished—the title, proudly
and characteristically enough bearing only
two names, “Buonaparte” at the top and
“Luigi van Beethoven” at the bottom—and
Beethoven heard of Napoleon’s elevation, he
said: “Can it be that he is no more than an
ordinary man? Now he, like others, will
trample all human rights under foot, serve
only his ambition and become a tyrant.” He
tore the title page in two, threw the work on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the floor and did not again look at it for a long
time. When it appeared in 1806, it was under
the name of the <i>Sinfonia Eroica</i>, “composed
to celebrate the memory of a great man.”
It was dedicated to Prince Lobkowitz, who
purchased it and caused it to be performed before
Prince Louis Ferdinand, in the fall of
1804. The Prince was so delighted with it
that he had it played three times the same
evening in immediate succession, which was a
very great satisfaction to Beethoven.</p>

<p>There is a oneness of spirit in this instrumental
fresco painting of a hero who strives
and suffers for the sake of what is most precious
to man, and in Beethoven’s only opera, the
<i>Fidelio</i>, which made the latter the natural
successor of the <i>Eroica</i>. Florestan dared
“boldly to tell the truth,” and this, his entering
the lists for right and freedom, incites his
faithful wife, Leonore, to a truly heroic deed.
Disguised in male attire, she enters the prison,
and, just in the nick of time, casts herself between
her beloved husband and his murderer.
Her cry—which has in it much of the heroism
of death—“kill first his wife,” is a bit of
history showing the enthusiasm of the ideally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
great, as it is also the most intense dramatic
representation, in tones, of the full energy of a
woman’s love.</p>

<p>In a letter to Amenda, in 1801, he wrote:
“I have composed music of every description,
except operas and church music.” But even,
a short time before this, he had something to
do with the theater. He had written the ballet
<i>Prometheus</i>, which represents in a sense, the
history of the creation of man in choreographic
pictures. The success of this work
determined Schikaneder, well known to the
readers of the life of Mozart, and who, at this
time, had the direction of the newly-built
theater in Vienna, to engage Beethoven at a
large annual stipend. When this man, Schikaneder,
in the same spring of 1803, saw that
the oratorio <i>Christus am Oelberge</i> (Christ on
the Mount of Olives) met with good success,
although more theatrical than spiritual in its
character, he commissioned him to write an
opera also. The subject was, probably, <i>Alexander</i>—a
very suitable one, considering Beethoven’s
own heroic style, and his feeling at
the time. But nothing came of it. There
can be no doubt, however, that a piece which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he had sketched and intended to make a part
of it, the duet, <i>O Namenlose Freude</i> (O
Nameless Joy), was afterwards embodied in the
<i>Fidelio</i>. Beethoven had received a commission
to write the latter from Baron von Braun, who
had taken charge of the theater in Vienna, in
the year 1804.</p>

<p>At this time, both the Abbe Vogler and
Cherubini were writing for the Viennese. The
compositions of the latter met with great success,
and made a powerful impression on Beethoven.
In these men he met with foes worthy
of his steel, and inducements great enough to
lead him to do his very best. His severe heart
trials and consequent disappointment had
taught him how lonely he was in the world.
Breuning wrote of him in 1804: “You have
no idea, my dear Wegeler, how indescribable,
and, I might say, horrible an impression his
partial loss of hearing has made on him....
What must be the feelings of one with such a
violent temper, to meet with such a misfortune!
And then his reserve, and his distrust frequently
of his best friend!” A subject like
that of the <i>Fidelio</i> must, of itself, have taken
strong hold of a man like Beethoven, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
of the powerful scene in which Leonore holds
her mortal enemy, Pizarro, spell-bound, with
the pistol in her hand. What must have most
affected him here, however, was the ideal background
of suffering for truth and freedom—for
Pizarro was a tyrant—and the fact that a
woman had the power that comes of genuine
fidelity to avert every danger from her beloved
husband, even at the risk of her own life.
And Beethoven endowed the work with his
exalted and almost transfigured background
of feeling, by means of his music, which here
depicts the constitution of his own nature, and
his whole intellectual build. He accurately
hits the decisive climax of the conflict, and
gives to the principal actors so much of real
personal character, that we cannot fail to recognize
them, and to understand their action
from their inner feelings. This, in connection
with a very powerful declamation, is the continuation
of the dramatic characteristics which
we greet in the <i>Fidelio</i>. The development of
the operatic form as such is not further carried
on in this work. In his pure instrumental
music, even more than in the <i>Fidelio</i>, Beethoven
has given form to the language of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
soul and to the great hidden springs of action
of the world and human nature.</p>

<p>A period may come when stricter demands
may be made on dramatic art, and when, as a
consequence, this work may not have as much
charm as it has for us, because of its fragmentary
character. But be this as it may, in some
of its details it will always appeal irresistibly
to the finest feeling. We find in it passages
like those in Beethoven’s improvisation which
never failed to draw from his hearers tears of
real happiness. The greater part of this language
was, like Mozart’s Cantilene, rich in
soul. Yet melodies like <i>Komm, Hoffnung, lass
den letzten Stern</i>, <i>In des Lebens Fruehlingstagen</i>
and <i>O namen, namenlose Freude</i>, are of
such a character that “humanity will never
forget them.” Like the Holy Grail, they furnish
food and light at the same time, and, like
certain forces, produce a greater yield in proportion
as greater demands are made upon
them. We frequently find in it expressions
that are simply inimitable, and when this
work is contemplated we see that it bears evidence
of a profundity of soul and of a development
of mind which separate—<i>toto coelo</i>—Beethoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
from his predecessors, Mozart not
excepted. Whole pieces in it are full of the
deepest and warmest dramatic life, made up of
the web and woof of the human soul itself.
Such, for instance, are <i>Wir muessen gleich zu
Werke schreiten</i>, the chorus of prisoners, the
picture of Florestan’s dungeon, the digging
of the grave, and above all the thrilling
<i>Toet’ erst sein Weib!</i> (kill first his wife). But
the center of all is, as may be seen from the
innumerable and most refined traits of the
music, Leonore, the pattern of heroic fidelity.
Her character stirred Beethoven to the very
depths of his soul, for her power of hope and
her devotion to freedom were his own. The
work itself was to be called <i>Leonore</i>, as, indeed,
the first piano-score was called in 1810.</p>

<p>This work has a meaning in the life of our
artist himself, greater, almost, than its importance
as a work of art.</p>

<p>The work required, for its completion, only
the spring and summer of the year 1805. The
sketches of it show how carefully the file was
used on its every part. Only the fire of enthusiastic
devotion was able to smelt the ore
of the separate arias, duets and terzettoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
which make up the matter of the whole; but
this it could not do here fully enough to produce
that natural flow which dramatic taste
even now demanded. Moreover, the storm of
war broke upon Vienna and deprived Beethoven’s
hearers of even the calm of devotion.
The result was that only the prima donna
Milder-Hauptmann satisfied the public in the
character of Leonore. Besides, Beethoven, as
a composer of purely instrumental music, had
not paid sufficient attention to the demands of
the human voice. On the 13th of October,
1805, Napoleon entered Vienna, and after the
20th the <i>Fidelio</i> was repeated three times;
not, however, before the art lovers of Vienna,
but before an audience composed of French
officers. It was received with little applause,
and after the first performance the house
remained empty. Beethoven withdrew the
work. But even the critics missed in it at this
time “that certain splendor of originality
characteristic of Beethoven’s works.” Our
artist’s friends now gathered about him to
induce him to make some abbreviations in the
opera. This was at the house of Lichnowsky.
Beethoven was never before seen so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
excited, and were it not for the prayers and
entreaties of the gentle and tender Princess
Christiane, he would certainly have agreed to
nothing. He consented at last to drop a few
numbers, but it took six full hours to induce
him to do even this. It is easy to explain this
fact: the work was the pet child of his brain.
Breuning now re-arranged the libretto. He
made the acting more vivacious and Beethoven
shortened the several pieces still more. The
work proved more acceptable to the public,
but Beethoven thought himself surrounded
by a network of intrigue, and, as he had
agreed only for a share in the profits, he once
more withdrew the work. We hear no more
of it until 1814. We shall see what effect its
production had when we reach that date in
Beethoven’s life.</p>

<p>But this re-arrangement led to a new overture
and to a new poetical expression of the
subject, to the great <i>Leonoren-Overture</i>, known
as No. 3, but which is properly No. 2. Beethoven,
in this overture, lets us hear, as if in
the voices of thousands, the depth of pain in
Florestan’s dungeon; the glance of hope that
flashes across his mind when he thinks of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Leonore; the struggle of love with native fear
in the heart of the woman; her daring risk of
her own life for her beloved husband, and in
the signal of trumpets, the coming of her rescuer;
the calm joy of the unutterably happy
husband, as well as the boisterous, stormy joy
of the prisoners, all of whom get their liberty
with this one slave; and, last of all, the loudest
song of praise of freedom and happiness.
The symphonic poem, <i>Leonore</i>, as a whole, far
surpasses the dramatic work itself. Together
with the <i>Eroica</i>, it is the second monumental
work of Beethoven’s genius in this early
period of his musical creations, and proves him
a matured master in his art.</p>

<p>The proud path thus entered on, he never
left.</p>

<p>Besides the works already mentioned, we
may, for the sake of completeness, mention the
following likewise: The <i>Opferlied</i> (1st arrangement),
<i>Seufzer eines Ungeliebten</i>, variations
<i>quant’è più bello</i>, about 1795; variations to <i>Nel

in 1799; variations in G major, composed in
1800, serenade op. 25; rondo, op. 51, I; variations,

in 1803; three marches op. 45, variations
to “Rule Brittannia,” and the <i>Wachtelschlag</i>,
1804; sonata op. 53, together with the
<i>andante</i> in F major, originally belonging to it,
the <i>triple concerto</i> op. 56, and the sonata op.
57, begun in 1804, <i>An die Hoffnung</i>, op. 32 and
trio op. 38, which appeared in 1805; fourth
concerto op. 58, composed in 1805; trio op. 36,

<p><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s</span> Heiligenstadt Will, written
in the year 1802, closed with this painful appeal:
“O thou, Providence, let one day more
of joy dawn on me. How long have I been a
stranger to the heartfelt echo of true happiness!
When, when, O God, can I feel it once
more in the temple of nature and of man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Never? No! O, that were too hard!” Our
artist’s thoughts were thus directed into channels
which carried him far from the scenes
immediately surrounding him into regions of
a higher existence—of an existence which he
soon described so exquisitely in the language
of music. The <i>Pastorale</i> which celebrates this
“Temple of nature” was originally designated
as No. 5, and was, therefore, intended to be
completed before the symphony in C minor.
But it would seem that Beethoven had to go
through many an internal conflict, the result
of his great depression of spirits, before he
could acquire the calmness of mind necessary
to form a proper conception of the “Peace of
God in Nature,” and to give it proper form
and expression in art.</p>

<p>Breuning wrote, on the 2nd of June, 1806,
that the intrigues about the <i>Fidelio</i> were all
the more disagreeable to Beethoven because
the fact that it had not been performed reduced
him to some pecuniary straits, and that it
would take all the longer time for him to recover,
as the treatment he had received deprived
him of a great deal of his love for his
work. Yet the first of the quartets, op. 59,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
bears the memorandum: “Begun on the 26th
of May, 1806;” and the fourth symphony
(op. 60), as well as the violin concerto (op.
61), also belong to this year. In the meantime
op. 56, which had been begun some time
previous, the triple concerto, op. 57, called the
<i>Apassionata</i>, and op. 58, the fourth concerto,
were all either continued or finished. What
wealth there is here—in the number of compositions,
in their magnitude and in their contents!
The three quartets are dedicated to
Count Rasumowsky, who had given Beethoven
the commission to write them, and who had
furnished the Russian melodies on which they
are based. How well the <i>adagio</i> of the second
of them points us to that higher region in
which Beethoven now felt himself more and
more at home. He himself told Czerny that
that <i>adagio</i> suggested itself to him one night,
when he was contemplating the starry heavens,
and thinking of the harmony of the spheres.
In the serene calmness of these vanishing
tones, we see the revolution of the stars
mirrored in all its grandeur. Here all
pain seems lightened, all passion stilled.
Yet how both had raged even in the <i>Apassionata</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the draft of which is to be found
immediately following that of the <i>Fidelio</i>.
The <i>Apassionata</i> is written in his heart-blood.
Its tones are cries of excitement the
most painful. It was finished in the summer,
and dedicated to Count Franz Brunswick.
An oil painting of the count’s sister, Countess
Theresa, was found among Beethoven’s effects,
after his death. It bore the superscription:
“To the rare genius, the great artist, the good
man. From T. B.” It is supposed that the
letter to his “immortal love,” already referred
to, was addressed to her—and it is truly a
letter which gives us a pen-picture of Beethoven’s
condition of mind at that time, and
which affords an idea of the “gigantic sweep
of his ideas.” It was found after his death, together
with other important papers, in an old
chest, and is dated on July 6, from a watering
place in Hungary. It is rightly supposed to
have been written in the year 1806, in which
Beethoven paid a visit to the Brunswicks. But,
be this as it may, it gives evidence of intense
feeling, and shows that Beethoven now dwelt
on that sublime height on which all earthly
desires are silent. It seems also to lead us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
over to the understanding and appreciation of
Beethoven’s subsequent creations, which henceforth
gain an ideal character not of this earth.
We can here touch only on the principal points
in these letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My angel, my all, my other self.” Thus does he
begin it on the 6th of July, in the morning. He proceeds:
“Only a few words to-day, and those in lead-pencil,
and that your own pencil, dear. Nothing can
be settled about my dwelling until to-morrow. What
a wretched loss of time for such trifles! Why
this deep affliction where necessity speaks? How
can our love continue to exist except through sacrifice,
except by limitation of our desires? Can you change
the fact that you are not entirely mine nor I entirely
yours? Look out on the beauties of nature, and resign
yourself to what must be. Love asks everything,
and rightly so. It does in my case. It does in your
case. But you forget too easily that I have to live for
you as well as for myself. Were we entirely one, you
would feel the pain there is in this as little as I....
We shall, I trust, soon meet.... I cannot tell you
to-day what reflections I have made upon my life,
during the past forty-eight hours. Were our hearts
always close to one another, I am sure I should make
no such reflections. My heart is too full to tell you
much. There are moments when I find that language
is nothing at all. Cheer up; be my faithful, my only
pet, my all, as I am all yours. The gods must direct
the rest in our lives. Thy faithful</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ludwig</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>But, on the same dainty little piece of note
paper, he continues, for the mail had already
left:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You suffer, dearest creature. Wherever I am,
you are with me. I must try to so arrange it that our
life may be one. But what, what a life to be thus
without you! I am pursued by the kindness of men
which I do not intend to earn, and yet, which I really
do earn. That a man should humble himself before
his fellow man, pains me; and when I consider myself
as a part of the universe, what am I, and who is He
they call the Most High? And yet here, again, we
find the divine in that which is human.... No
matter how great your love for me, my love for you is
greater still. Never hide yourself from me. Good
night! Being an invalid, I must go to sleep. Alas,
that I should be so near and yet so far from you. Is
not our love a real firmament of heaven? And is it
not as firm as the foundation of the heavens?”</p>
</div>

<p>He takes up the same piece of paper once
more:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good morning, this 7th of July! Even before I rise
my thoughts fly to you, dear—to you, immortal love, now
joyfully, now sadly, waiting to see whether the fates will
hear our prayer. If I shall live at all, it must be with
you. I am resolved to wander about far away from
you, until the time comes when I may fly into your
arms, and say that I belong to you; until I may send
my soul absolved by you, dear, into the land of spirits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Yes, unfortunately it must be so. You will be all the
more composed, since you know how faithful I am to
you. Another can never possess my heart—never!
Why, O God, must a man be so widely separated from
the object of his love? And yet the life I now live in
Vienna is so wretched! Your love makes me, at
once, the happiest and the most unfortunate of men.
At my present age, there should be some uniformity
in my life; but is such a thing possible in my present
circumstances? Be patient. Only by the patient
contemplation of our existence can we gain our object
and live united. Be patient! love me! How I longed
and wept for you to-day and yesterday; you, my life,
my all! Farewell; love me ever, never forget the most
faithful heart of thy beloved Ludwig. I am ever thine
and thou forever mine.”</p>
</div>

<p>How completely like Beethoven! It was
during this very summer that he completed
the <i>Apassionata</i>, which he always considered
the greatest of his sonatas, at the home of the
Brunswicks. Can it be said that its language
is in anything greater than the language of
this letter? He seems at this time to be nearly
always possessed by a feeling of melancholy.
But for this very reason he took refuge more
than ever in music. It was, indeed, a real
sanctuary to him, and he refused to open that
sanctuary to the eyes of strangers, and, least of
all, to the eyes of enemies. This he very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
plainly proved to Prince Lichnowsky during
the fall. Beethoven had left Hungary and
was spending some time in Silesia with the
prince. The latter desired him to play for
some French officers who were quartered in his
castle. A violent scene immediately ensued.
After it was over, Beethoven left the castle.
He refused to go back with the prince who had
followed him, but repaired, post haste, back to
Vienna, in which city the prince’s bust was
broken to pieces as an expiatory sacrifice. It
was not long, however, before the old friendship
of the two was re-established.</p>

<p>In the quartet sketches of this year, we find
the words: “Just as you can cast yourself here
into the whirl of society, it is possible to write
operas spite of all social impediments. Let
the fact that you do not hear be a mystery no
longer, even in your music.” This “whirl of
society” introduces us to some new acquaintances.
Count Rasumowsky held very brilliant
soirées, at which the amiable and charming
wife of his librarian, Marie Bigot, performed
some of Beethoven’s works in an exquisite
manner. The playing of the elegant
and handsome Countess Marie Erdoedy, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Beethoven himself called his “father confessor,”
was not inferior to that of Madame
Bigot. Other patrons of the musical art were
Madame Dorothea von Ertmann, a charming
Frankfort lady, and the Malfattis, one of whom
was Beethoven’s physician. The home of
Streicher, who had married Nanette Stein,
daughter of the Augsburg piano-maker, described
in Mozart’s letter of 1777 in so droll
a manner, was the rendezvous of lovers of
music. Nor must we forget to mention Prince
Lobkowitz and the Emperor’s youngest brother,
the Archduke Rudolph, Beethoven’s distinguished
pupil, who, as our artist himself admitted,
understood music thoroughly.</p>

<p>The chief value, however, of the works
quoted above, is that they inform us how
Beethoven, spite of his experience with the
<i>Fidelio</i>, was thinking very seriously of the
writing of “operas.” If successful here, his
fortune was made, and there was nothing then
to hinder the crowning of his love by marriage.
There now seemed to be a very good
prospect of that success, for, in the year 1807,
the two court-theaters passed into the hands
of a company of noblemen, with Lobkowitz at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
their head. Lobkowitz immediately called
upon Beethoven to act as composer for the
Court-theater. Our artist accepted the position,
and bound himself to write at least one
great opera and operetta each year, and to supply
whatever other music might be needed. A
feeling of inexhaustible power must have inspired
him at this time, when he was actuated
by the tenderest love, with the utmost confidence
in self. A forcible proof of this is the
overture which he then wrote to Collins’s <i>Coriolanus</i>.
But the gentlemen did not accede to
his wishes; they did not want to trust him as
composer of instrumental music in this point;
and thus Beethoven, although not particularly
pleased by the action of his princely friends,
was, fortunately for himself and for us, retained
in the field of labor most in harmony
with his disposition.</p>

<p>“If it be true that genuine strength and a
fullness of deep feeling characterize the Germans,
we must say that Beethoven was, above
all, a German artist. In this, his most recent
work, we cannot but admire the expressiveness
and depth of his music, which so grandly
painted the wild, perturbed mind of <i>Coriolanus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and the sudden and terrible change in his
fate, while it elicited the sublimest emotion.”
These lines are from an account of a concert
given in the <i>Augarten</i> by Lichnowsky in the
spring of 1807. But we have very reliable information
that Beethoven was now engaged on
the symphony in C minor and on the <i>Pastorale</i>.
Thanks to Clementi, who was doing a
large and thriving music business in London,
and to his old friend Simrock, in Bonn, which
was French at the time, he felt at his ease so
far as money matters were concerned. He
writes to Brunswick on the 11th of May, 1807:
“I can now hope to be able, in a few years, to
maintain the dignity of a real artist.” And
when, in the same letter, we read the farther
passage, “Kiss your sister Theresa. Tell
her that I fear that I shall become great
without a monument, to which she has contributed,”
we can understand how love, fame
and lofty intuition conspired to fit him for new
and mighty exploits in art.</p>

<p>The next work published by Beethoven was
the Mass in C, op. 86, which Esterhazy gave
him a commission to write. But here Beethoven,
even more than in opera, missed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
spirit of his subject. The Mass bears witness
to his intellect, and has all the charms of
sound; but it is not a religious composition.
When Beethoven himself wrote to Esterhazy,
as he did at this time: “Shall I tell you that
it is not without many misgivings that I shall
send you the Mass, for I know you are accustomed
to have the inimitable works of the
great Haydn performed for you,” he proves
that he did not understand the real spirit of
church music; for Haydn had, just as little as
Beethoven, a true conception of what church
music is. Haydn was now seventy-six years
old, and Beethoven attended a performance of
his <i>Creation</i> the following year, and, with a
number of the distinguished nobility, received
the celebrated guest at the door. The fame
of the man whom he was thus called upon to
honor, was a type of what his own was destined
one day to be. And what his own fame
would be, the production of the great works
he had recently finished, must have enabled
him to foresee. When the Mass was performed,
in September, 1807, in Eisenstadt, our
composer had a personal falling out—the result
of a misunderstanding—with Mozart’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
pupil, Hummel; and one which was not made
up for for some years. The prince had criticised
Beethoven’s Mass by asking the strange question:
“But, my dear Beethoven, what have
you been doing now?” Hummel could not
help laughing at this strange mode of criticism.
Beethoven supposed he was laughing
at his work; and after this would have nothing
more to do with the prince.</p>

<p>It was otherwise with the magnanimous,
noble lover of art, Prince Lobkowitz, one of the
principal grandees of Bohemia, and one of the
principal patrons of the theater. To him Beethoven
was indebted for the suggestion that the
<i>Fidelio</i> should be performed in Prague. For
the occasion, Beethoven wrote, in this year,
1807, the overture, op. 138, which is, therefore,
to be accounted not the second, but the
third <i>Leonore</i> overture. The performance of
the <i>Fidelio</i>, however, did not take place until
1814, the same year in which it was performed
in Vienna. In the following summer (1808), it
was publicly announced that “the gifted Beethoven
had conceived the idea to put Goethe’s
Faust to music, as soon as he could find any
one to prepare it for the stage.” The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
part of Faust had appeared in 1807, as a
“tragedy;” and, as we shall see, the poem
made a deep impression on our artist. Long
after, and even on his death-bed, it occupied
his thoughts. But he had, even now, written
some Faust music—the symphony in C minor.
To it we now turn, for it is one of the greatest
of Beethoven’s creations.</p>

<p>We have seen how Beethoven himself once
said: “Power is the moral code of men who
distinguish themselves above others.” And
so we hear how one person described him as
“power personified;” how another said of him
that “a Jupiter occasionally looked out through
his eyes:” and a third, that “his magnificent
forehead was the seat of majestic, creative
power.” Spurred on by the opposition of
“fate,” that is, by what nature had denied him,
we see this power appear in all its concentration
and sublimity. The power which has
created, and which preserves all things, has
been called “will,” and music, one of its immediate
phenomena, while the other arts are
only reflections of that will, and reflect only
the things of the world. In the first movement
of the symphony in C minor, we feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the presence of this power or personal will, to
an extent greater than in any other work of
art. It there appears in fullest action, in all
its nobility. The symphony might not inappropriately
have been called the Jupiter-symphony;
for it is a veritable head of Jove, such
as only a Phidias could have imagined. Melody
has been described as the history of the
will illuminated by reason, and the sonata-form
of the symphony is just such kind of
melody. And it is this fifth symphony of
Beethoven’s, which, more than any other, tells
us the most secret history of that personal
will, of all its strivings and motions. No
type in any art, could have suggested a Siegfried
to Richard Wagner. Here Beethoven’s genius
acts as force, as will, and as the conscious intelligence
of the prototype of the Great Spirit.
Yet when the work was performed in Paris,
Hector Berlioz heard his teacher, Lessieur, say
of it—and this, although he was deeply moved
by it—“but such music should not be heard.”
“Don’t be afraid,” was the reply, “there will
be little of that kind of music written.” How
correct was the insight of the gifted Frenchman!
Siegfried’s <i>Rheinfahrt</i>, in the <i>Goetterdaemmerung</i>,
is music of “that kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>But it is only the night of sorrow that gives
birth to the concentration of power. It is only
by great effort that this energy can be maintained.
And as Coriolanus finely presses all the
darts aimed at him by his mother into her
own heart, in defying sacrifice, so we find, in
the background of this holiest and most manly
will, the consciousness of the variety and
transitory character of all things. In his
heart of hearts, Beethoven feels that fate has
knocked at his door, only because in his following
the dictates of force and action, he has
sinned against nature, and that all will is only
transitoriness and self-deception. The <i>adagio</i>
expresses subjection to a higher will. The
consciousness of this highest act of the will,
to sacrifice one’s self and yet to preserve one’s
freedom, gave birth to the song of jubilation
in the <i>finale</i> which tells not of the joy and
sorrow of one heart only; it lifts the freedom
which has been praised and sought for into the
higher region of moral will. Thus the symphony
in C minor has a significance greater than
any mere “work of art.” Like the production
of religious art, it is a representation of those
secret forces which hold the world together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>The consciousness of this deeper, intimate
dependence of all things on one another, is
henceforth seen like a glimmer of light in the
darkness which gathered around him, and it
continues to beautify and transfigure his creations.</p>

<p>The <i>Pastorale</i> immediately followed the
symphony in C minor. It gives expression
to the peace of nature and to the fulfillment of
the saying: “Look out on the beauties of nature
and calm your soul by the contemplation
of what must be.” While the fourth symphony
compared with the fifth, is a symphony
and nothing more—even if it be Beethoven’s—we
plainly discover in this sixth, the poetic
spirit, the pure feeling of God. The idea and
character it illustrates constitutes in Beethoven’s
life the transition from the external beauty
of nature to the comprehension of the eternal.
Over it is written: “Recollections of country
life,” but also, “More an expression of feeling
than a painting.” “The Beethovens loved
the Rhine,” the young playmates of the boy
Ludwig were wont to say, and he wrote himself
to Wegeler: “Before me is the beautiful
region in which I first saw the light as plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and as beautiful as the moment I left you.”
On a leaf, written in his own hand, we find
the words: “O the charm of the woods—who
can express it?” But now that he was compelled
to live a solitary life, nature became to
him a mother, sister and sweetheart. He
looked upon the wonders of nature as into
living eyes; she calmed him who was naturally
of such a stormy temperament, and to whom
life had been unkind in so many ways. In
the <i>Scene am Bach</i> (Scene by the Brook), the
waters murmur peace to his soul; and the
birds by the brooklet, in Heiligenstadt, where
these two symphonies were finished, whisper
joy. His <i>Lustiges Zusammensein der Landleute</i>,
infuses new courage into the heart, and
when his <i>Gewitter und Sturm</i>, tells of the
might of the Eternal, the shepherds express
their joyful and grateful feelings in the words:
<i>Herr wir danken dir</i>. The <i>finale</i>, like the
<i>Chorphantasie</i> (op. 80), planned in 1800 but
not finished until 1808, was intended to contain
a chorus expressing in words the joyful
and thankful feeling of the people. Beethoven’s
own personal experience is always expressed
in his music. A more intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
acquaintance with nature gave it to him to
find yet deeper expression for the feelings
which it excites in our hearts, as its everlasting
change enabled him to conceive the eternal
and imperishable.</p>

<p>We now turn to a whole series of new and
brilliant creations of our hero. It would seem
as if his intercourse with the eternal in nature
had given him new life.</p>

<p>During these years, Beethoven’s intimacy
with the Malfattis and their two charming
daughters, was a great source of pleasure to
him. His feelings towards them may be inferred
from the following passages in his notes
to his friend Gleichenstein. He writes: “I
feel so well when I am with them that they
seem able to heal the wounds which bad men
have inflicted on my heart.”... “I expect
to find there in the <i>Wilden Mann</i> in the park,
no wild men, but beautiful graces.” And
again: “My greetings, to all who are dear to
you and to me. How gladly would I add—and
to whom we are dear???? These points
of interrogation are becoming, at least in me.”
Gleichenstein married the second daughter,
Anna Malfatti, in 1811. To the young dark-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Theresa, who made her debut in society
about this time, and whom he writes of as
“volatile, taking everything in life lightly”
but “with so much feeling for all that is beautiful
and good, and a great talent for music,”
he sends a sonata, and recommends Goethe’s
Wilhelm Meister and Schlegel’s translation of
Shakespeare. We thus see that his intercourse
with the family had that intellectual foundation
which Beethoven could not dispense with,
on anything. It would even seem as if, in his
enthusiasm to put his strength to the test of
new deeds, even his “eternal loved one”
should fade from his view.</p>

<p>The cello sonata (op. 69) dedicated to his
friend Gleichenstein immediately followed the
<i>Pastorale</i>. The two magnificent trios dedicated
to Countess Erdoedy, with whom he
resided at this time, follow as op. 70. The
first movement of the trio in D major is a
brilliantly free play of mind and force, while
the <i>adagio</i> suggests Faust lost in the deep
contemplation of nature and its mysteries.
The whole, on account of the mysterious awe
expressed by this movement has been called by
musicians the <i>Fledermaustrio</i>, i. e., the bat-trio.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
The <i>Leonore</i> is numbered op. 72. It
was published in 1810. Op. 73, the most
beautiful of all concertos, was dedicated to the
Archduke Rudolph. We have further, op.
74, the harp-quartet, dedicated to Prince
Lobkowitz, and the fantasia for the piano, op.
77, to his friend Brunswick; lastly, the sonata
in F sharp major, op. 78, very highly valued
by Beethoven himself, dedicated to his sister
Theresa. Verily “new acts” enough, and
what glorious deeds!</p>

<p>This brings us to the year 1809, which witnessed
a change for the better in Beethoven’s
pecuniary circumstances. He now received a
permanent salary. On the 1st of November,
1808, he wrote to the Silesian Count, Oppersdorf,—whom
he had visited in the fall of 1806,
in company with Lichnowsky, and who gave
him a commission to write a symphony, which
the count, however, never received—as follows:
“My circumstances are improving without the
assistance of people who entertain their friends
with blows. I have also been called to act as
<i>capellmeister</i> to the King of Westphalia, and
perhaps I may obey the call.” The following
December, Beethoven gave a great concert, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
programme of which embraced the two new
symphonies, parts of his Mass, the concerto in
G minor, and the <i>Chorphantasie</i>. He himself
improvised at the piano. The attention
of people far and near was called anew to this
great and grave master in music, whom the
sensualist Jerome Bonaparte endeavored to attract
to his Capua in Cassel, and they became
anxious lest he might leave Vienna. Beethoven’s
friends bestirred themselves to keep
him in Vienna, as did Beethoven himself to
stay. This is very evident from the letters to
Gleichenstein and Erdoedy. Three friends of
his, to whom it was largely due that he wrote
one of his greatest works, were instrumental
in keeping him in Vienna. They were the
Archduke Rudolph, Prince Lobkowitz and
Prince Kinsky, to whose wife the six songs, op.
75, are dedicated. The sum guaranteed
amounted to eight thousand marks. “You
see, my dear good Gleichenstein,” he writes,
on the 18th of March, 1809, <i>a propos</i> of the
“decree” which he had received on the 26th
of February, from the hands of the archduke,
and which imposed on him no duty but to
remain in Vienna and Austria, “how honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to me my stay here has become.” He
could not, however, have meant seriously what
he added immediately after: “The title of imperial
<i>capellmeister</i> will come to me also;” for
what use had a man like the Emperor Franz
for such an “innovator” at his court? The
dedications of his works mentioned above
were simply testimonials of gratitude for the
friendship thus shown him.</p>

<p>He now planned an extensive journey,
which was to embrace England, and even
Spain. He writes to Gleichenstein: “Now
you can help me get a wife. If you find a
pretty one—one who may perhaps lend a sigh
to my harmonies, do the courting for me.
But she must be beautiful; I cannot love anything
that is not beautiful; if I could I should
fall in love with myself.” The coming war
interrupted all his plans. But, at the same
time, it suggested to the imagination of our
artist, that wonderful picture of the battle of
forces, the seventh (A major) symphony (op.
92), which Richard Wagner has called the
“apotheosis of the dance.” Germany now
first saw the picture of a genuinely national
war. Napoleon appeared as Germany’s hereditary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
foe, and the whole people, from the highest
noble to the meanest peasant rose up, as
one man, to fight the battle of freedom. The
march is, after all, only the dance of war, and
Beethoven gathered into one picture of instrumentation,
the glad tramp of warlike hosts,
the rhythm of trampling steeds, the waving of
standards and the sound of trumpets, with a
luminousness such as the world had never
witnessed before. The poet needs only see the
eddy created by a mill-wheel to paint the vapor
and foam of Charybdis. In the case of Beethoven,
this joy in the game of war was, as
the character of Bonaparte, on another occasion,
a stimulant to his imagination, which
now painted a picture of the free play of force
and of human existence from the material of
recent historical events. And even in after
years the timeliness of this work and the
spirit which called it into existence were evident.
And, as we shall soon see, it constituted
the principal part in the musical celebration,
when, in 1813, the real war of emancipation
occurred and led to a most decided victory.
Personally, Beethoven felt himself not inferior
to the mighty conqueror in natural power, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
like Schiller, he clearly foresaw the awakening
of the national genius which overthrew Napoleon.
To this second-sight of the prophet,
possessed by every genuine poet—to this sure
presentiment of ultimate triumph—our artist
owed it, that, even in the days of Germany’s
greatest ignominy and subjection he sang of
the disenthrallment of the mind and of the
jubilation of victory. Napoleon defeated the
Austrians again. But as Beethoven first felt
the weight and the power of resistance of
Germany after the battles of Aspern and Wagram,
he now depicted (after Napoleon had
taken the Emperor’s daughter to wife and
seemed predestined to become the despot of all
Europe), in the <i>scherzo</i> and <i>finale</i> of the
seventh symphony, better than ever before,
the jubilation of the victorious nation, with all
its popular feasts and games. Yet, in the
melancholy second part, with its monotonous
beats on the <i>dominante</i>, we think we
hear the gloomy rhythm of a funeral march.
This exceedingly characteristic theme is found
at the very beginning of a sketch-book of the
year 1809.</p>

<p>Affairs were for a time in a very bad condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
in Vienna and all Austria. The burthen
of taxation was severely felt. Everything
was at a standstill. When his beloved pupil,
the Archduke Rudolph retreated from Vienna
he wrote the <i>Lebewohl</i> of the sonata op. 81<sup>a</sup>;
but its <i>finale</i> (<i>die Ankunft</i>) was not written
until the 30th of January, 1810. The summer
was a dreary one to Beethoven, and there
was no demand for the exercise of his genius.
Following Ph. E. Bach, Kirnberger, Fux
and Albrechtsberger he prepared the <i>Materiellen
zum Generalbass</i> (materials for thorough-bass)
for his noble pupil. This work was
subsequently but wrongly published under
the name of <i>Beethoven’s Studien</i>. On the 8th
of September, a charity concert was given at
which—to the disgrace of the period, be it
said, for Napoleon had only just left Schoenbrunn—the
<i>Eroica</i> was performed, Beethoven
himself holding the baton. The rest of the
summer he hoped to spend in some quiet
corner in the country. He sojourned sometime
with the Brunswicks in Hungary, and
composed those works of his genius, op. 77
and 78. His genius, indeed, seems to have
awakened to a new life during this fall of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
1809. For the sketch-book of the seventh
symphony (op. 92) contains sketches of the
8th (op. 93) also; and Beethoven contemplated
giving another concert at Christmas,
at which, of course, only new works
could be performed. These sketches are followed
by drafts for a new concerto. On these
drafts we find the words: <i>Polonaise fuer
Clavier allein</i>, also <i>Freude schoener Goetterfunken</i>—“finish
the overture” and “detached
periods like princes are beggars, not
the whole.” He here takes up once more
those ideas of his youth, but with a grander
conception of their meaning. They constitute
the intellectual germ of the <i>finale</i> of the
ninth symphony. But the melody which he
actually noted down was elaborated in 1814
into the overture op. 115 (<i>Zur Namensfeier</i>).</p>

<p>During this period of Germany’s national
awakening, the theaters had again turned their
attention to Schiller’s dramas. The effect of
this was to revive Beethoven’s youthful ideas.
He now desired to give <i>Tell</i> a musical
dress. He had already received a commission
of this kind for the <i>Egmont</i>, and, on the occasion
of his receiving it, he gave expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
to a remarkable opinion. Said he to Czerny:
“Schiller’s poems are exceedingly difficult to
set to music. The composer must be able to
rise high above the poet. But who can rise
higher than Schiller? Goethe is much easier.”
And, indeed, his <i>Egmont</i> overture breathes a
higher spirit and takes a loftier flight than
Goethe’s beautiful tragedy. The composition
of this music led to his more intimate acquaintance
with the poet. To this same year,
1810, belong the incomparable songs <i>Kennst
du das Land</i>, and <i>Herz mein Herz</i>, in op. 75.</p>

<p>This year, 1810, brings us to a somewhat
mysterious point in Beethoven’s life, to his
<i>Heirathspartie</i> (marriage speculation).</p>

<p>In the spring, he writes to his friend Zmeskall:
“Do you recollect the condition I am
in—the condition of Hercules before Queen
Omphale? Farewell, and never again speak
of me as the great man, for I never felt either
the weakness or the strength of human nature
as I do now.” But writing to Wegeler on the
second of May, he says: “For a couple of
years I have ceased to lead a quiet and peaceful
life. I was carried by force into the
world’s life. Yet I would be happy, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
one of the very happiest of men, were it not
that the demon has taken up his abode in my
ears. Had I not read somewhere that man
should not voluntarily take leave of life while
he is still able to do one good deed, I should
long have departed hence, and by my own
act. Life is very beautiful, but, in my case,
it is poisoned forever.” He asked for the
certificate of his baptism, and this in a manner
so urgent that it creates surprise. It was
three months before the answer to the enigma
was found, and Breuning wrote that he believed
that Beethoven’s engagement was
broken off. But it continues a mystery, even
to this day, who his choice was. It has been
surmised that it was his “immortal loved one,”
or Theresa Brunswick. But we know nothing
certain on this point. True, he had now
acquired both fame and a position which raised
him above all fear of want. But she was
thirty-two years old, and he hard of hearing.
In addition to this, there was, on his side, a
relationship of the nature of which we shall
yet have something to say. Her passion, if
such there was on her part, must have been
prudently concealed; and it is certainly remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
that, from this time forward, her
name is not mentioned by Beethoven. However,
her niece, Countess Marie Brunswick,
who is still living, expressly writes: “I never
heard of any intimate relation nor of any love
between them, while Beethoven’s profound
love for my father’s cousin, Countess Guicciardi,
was a matter of frequent mention.” But
Giulietta had at this time long been Countess
Gallenberg. The solution of this mystery,
accordingly, belongs to the future.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have a few notes to
Gleichenstein, who married the younger Malfatti,
the following year. In one of them we
read: “You live on still, calm waters—in a
safe harbor. You do not feel or should not
feel the distress of the friend who is caught in
the storm. What will people think of me
in the planet Venus Urania? How can one
judge of me who has never seen me? My
pride is so humbled, that even without being
ordered to do so, I would travel thither with
thee.” And, in the other: “The news I
received from you cast me down again out of
the regions of happiness. What is the use
of saying that you would send me word when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
there was to be music again? Am I nothing
more than a musician to you and to others?
Nowhere but in my own bosom can I find
a resting-place. Externally, to myself there
is none. No, friendship and feelings like
it have only pain for me. Be it so, then.
Poor Beethoven, there is no external happiness
for you. You must create your own
happiness. Only in the ideal world do you
find friends.” The sketch of that and Klaerchen’s
song <i>Freudvoll und leidvoll</i> were
found in the possession of Theresa Malfatti.
When Gleichenstein was engaged, the feelings
of the man who had been so bitterly deceived
overflowed. But how could the young girl of
eighteen dare to do what the grave Countess
would not venture? Theresa Brunswick died
unmarried. Theresa Malfatti married, in 1817,
one Herr von Drossdick. Nevertheless, Beethoven’s
intercourse with the family continued.</p>

<p>We next hear of his acquaintance with
Bettina Brentano which led to his meeting
Goethe in person.</p>

<p>Her brother Francis had married a Miss
Birkenstock, of Vienna. Beethoven had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
long and well acquainted with the Birkenstock
family. Bettina Brentano herself was
betrothed to Achim von Arnim, and her
deep love of music had inspired her with a
genuine affection for Beethoven. One beautiful
day in May, she, in the utmost simplicity
of heart, went, in company with her married
sister, Mrs. Savigny, to Beethoven and met
with the very best reception. He sang for
her <i>Kennst du das Land</i>, with a sharp
and unpleasant voice. Her eyes sparkled.
“Aha!” said Beethoven, “most men are
touched by something good. But such men
have not the artist’s nature. Artists are fiery
and do not weep.” He escorted her home to
Brentano’s, and after this they met every day.</p>

<p>Bettina at this time sent Goethe an account
of the impression made on her by Beethoven’s
appearance and conversation. Her
charming letters are to be found in the Cotta
<i>Beethovenbuch</i>. They show how exalted an
idea Beethoven had of his own high calling.
She writes: “He feels himself to be the
founder of a new sensuous basis of the intellectual
life of man. He begets the undreamt-of
and the uncreated. What can such a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
have to do with the world? Sunrise finds
him at his blessed day’s work, and at sunset he
is as busy as at early morning. He forgets
even his daily food. O! Goethe, no Emperor
or King is as conscious of his power and of
the fact that all power proceeds from him, as
is this man Beethoven.” And Goethe, who
“loved to contemplate and fix in memory
the picture of real genius,” who well knew
“that his intellect was even greater than his
genius, and who frequently throws from himself
a luminousness like that of lightning, so
that we can scarcely tell, as we sit in the
darkness, from what side the day may break,”
invited him to Carlsbad, whither he was wont
to go every year.</p>

<p>The two remarkable letters to Bettina of
the 11th of August, 1810, and the 10th of
February, 1811, the autographs of which
have since been found, show us how deeply
the heart of our artist was stirred by love
at this time. They are to be found in
“Beethoven Letters.” A work of his composed
about this time, the <i>Quartetto serioso</i>, op.
95, of October, 1810, throws some light on
this love, and yet it rises far above the pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and the sorrow of the situation in which he
found himself. Heavy thunders announce
Vulcan at work; but in the <i>finale</i>, how Beethoven’s
giant mind frees itself from itself!
The noble, powerful soaring Trio op. 97 dates
from the spring of 1811, and, especially in the
<i>adagio</i>, gives evidence of wonderful heartfelt
bliss. But the fact that in this period no other
compositions were written would go to show the
influence of bitter experience. It may be,
however, that the commission he received for
the plays “The Ruins of Athens” and “King
Stephen,” took up the best portion of his
time; and, besides, the two symphonies had to
be finished. The song <i>An die Geliebte</i> also
belongs to this year 1811, as well as the principal
draft of op. 96, the charmingly coquettish
sonata for the violin which was finished in
1812, on the occasion of the visit of the then
celebrated violin player Rode to Vienna.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s work on these two plays took up
the summer of 1811, but they were not put
upon the stage until the spring of 1812. At
the same time, an opera was wanted for Vienna.
It was the “Ruins of Babylon.” He also
received an invitation to Naples, where Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Gallenberg was director of the theater. We
next find him traveling to Teplitz, a bathing
place, where he formed a more intimate acquaintance
with Varnhagen, Tiedge and Elise
von der Recke. Amalie Sebald, a nut-brown
maid of Berlin, twenty-five years of age, was
stopping with Elise. Amalie had a charming
voice, and was as remarkable for her intellectual
endowments as for her beauty of physique.
Beethoven, spite of his many disappointments,
was greatly taken with her. Her picture is
before us. Her eye betokens intellect and
nobility of soul, and her mouth extreme
loveliness. Beethoven subsequently wrote to
Tiedge: “Press the Countess’s hand for me
very tenderly, but very respectfully. Give
Amalie a right loving kiss, when no one is
looking.” He did not see Goethe on this
occasion. He was at Teplitz again the following
year, when his meeting—of which so
much has been said and written—“with the
most precious jewel of the German nation,”
as he called Goethe, when writing to Bettina,
occurred. We can here give only the principal
incidents of that event.</p>

<p>The Austrian imperial couple, their daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the Empress of France, the King of Saxony,
the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and a great
many Princes were there. The company already
in the place was joined by Goethe, the
jurist Savigny and his brother-in-law, A. von
Arnim, together with his charming wife, Bettina.
Beethoven himself writes on the 12th
of August, 1812, to his Archduke in Vienna:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was in Goethe’s company a great deal.” And
the poet, writing to Zelter, passes the following judgment
on Beethoven: “I became acquainted with Beethoven
in Teplitz. His wonderful talent astounded
me. But, unfortunately, he is an utterly untamed
character. He is not, indeed, wrong in finding the
world detestable. Still, his finding it detestable does
not make it any more enjoyable either to himself or to
others. But he is very excusable and much to be
pitied. His hearing is leaving him. He is by nature
laconic, and this defect is making him doubly so.”</p>
</div>

<p>The remarkable incident related in the
third letter to Bettina, a letter which has been
widely read and the authenticity of which has
been much contested—for the original does
not seem to be extant—Bettina herself describes
in a letter to Pueckler-Muskau. Goethe,
she says, who had received many marks
of attention from the Princes present, was desirous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of testifying his special devotion to the
Empress, and in “solemn, unassuming expressions”
signified to Beethoven that he should do
the same. But Beethoven replied: “What!
You must not do so. You must let them
clearly understand what they possess in you;
for if you do not, they will never find it out.
I have taken quite a different course.” And
then he told how his Archduke once sent him
word to wait, and how, instead of doing so, he
went away. Princes might indeed, he said,
decorate one with the insignia of an order, or
make a man a court counsellor, but they could
never make a Goethe or a Beethoven. To
such men they owed respect. The whole court
now came in. Beethoven said to Goethe:
“Keep my arm; they must make way for us.”
But Goethe left him and stood aside with
his hat in his hand, while Beethoven, with folded
arms, went through the midst of them
and only touched his hat. The court party
separated to make place for him, and they had
all a friendly greeting for our artist. He
stood and waited at the other end for Goethe,
who bowed profoundly as the court party
passed him. Now Beethoven said: “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
waited for you, because I honor and respect
you, as you deserve, but you have done them
too much honor.” Then, it is said, Beethoven
ran to them, and told them all that had happened.</p>

<p>That his behavior, on this occasion, was
not by any means dictated by any over-estimation
of himself, but by a deep human
feeling of equality—an equality which the
artist finds it harder than any one else to assert
and acquire—the whole course of Beethoven’s
life, as well as his intercourse with people at
this bathing place at Teplitz, proves. He
there found Miss Sebald again. A series of
very tender notes written to her tells us of his
heartfelt and good understanding with this
refined and clever North German lady, who
made greater allowances for his natural disposition
than were wont to be made. He
writes in 1816: “I found one whom, I am sure,
I shall never possess.” His admission that, for
five years—that is from 1811,—he had known
a lady to be united to whom he would have
esteemed it the greatest happiness he could
have on earth, was made in this same year.
But, he added, that was a happiness not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
thought of; union with her was an impossibility,
a chimera! And yet he closed with
the words: “It is still as it was the first day
I saw her. I cannot dismiss the thought of
her from my mind.” He did not know that
Amalie Sebald had been the wife of a councillor
of justice named Krause. Again did he
give vent to his feeling in the songs <i>An die
ferne Geliebte</i>—“to the distant loved one”—which
bear the date; “in the month of
April, 1816.”</p>

<p>This was the last time that Beethoven seriously
concerned himself about marriage. Fate
would indeed have it that he should soon become
a “father,” but without a wife. Yet no
matter what the personal wishes of our artist
through the rest of his life may have been, or
what the wants he felt, his eye was ever fixed
on a lofty goal; and it was in the ideal world
that he found his real friends. He finished
the seventh symphony, and after it the eighth,
in this fall of 1812. The coquettish <i>allegretto
scherzando</i> of the latter was suggested by the
Maelzl metronome invented a short time before,
and the strange minuet with its proud
step is a hit at the high court society whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Beethoven so solemnly warned that the times
of the old regime, when the principle <i>l’état
c’est moi</i> obtained in society, were passed.
These works are clearly expressive of the free
and progressive spirit of a new and better age.
It was the seventh symphony especially that,
in the broadest sense, opened to Beethoven
himself the hearts of that age. This symphony
helped celebrate the newly-won peace established
by the Congress of Vienna. Beethoven
now entered a new stage of development,
and rose to his full height as an artist
and a man. Other works composed by Beethoven
during this period are the following:
82 variations (1806-7); <i>In questa tomba</i>
(1807); <i>Sonatine</i> (op. 79); variations op. 76
and <i>Lied aus der Ferne</i> (composed 1809);
<i>Die laute Klage</i> (probably 1809); Sextett op.
8<sup>b</sup>. <i>Andenken</i>, <i>Sehnsucht</i> by Goethe; <i>Der Liebende</i>,
<i>Der Juengling in der Fremde</i> (appeared
in 1810); three songs by Goethe, op. 83, (composed
in 1810); Scotch songs (commenced in
1810); four ariettes, op. 82, (appeared 1811);
trio in one movement and three <i>equale</i> for
four trombones, (composed in 1812) the latter
of which was re-arranged as a dirge for Beethoven’s
burial.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Resignation</span>, the most absolute and heartfelt
resignation to thy fate! Thou shouldst
not live for thyself, but only for others.
Henceforth there is no happiness for thee, but
in thy art. O God, grant me strength to
conquer myself. Nothing should now tie me
to life.” With this cry of the heart, taken
<i>verbatim</i> from his diary of 1812, Beethoven
consecrated himself to the noble task which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
after this he never lost sight of—of writing
“for the honor of the Almighty, the Eternal,
the Infinite.”</p>

<p>The national bankruptcy of Austria did not
leave Beethoven unaffected. It compelled
him, besides, to come to the assistance of his
sick brother, Karl. The first thing, therefore,
that he felt called upon to undertake, in
order to provide himself with the mere means
of subsistence, was the public representation of
his new compositions. It was not long before
an occasion of an extraordinary kind offered,
an occasion which lifted Beethoven’s creations
to the dignity of one of the motive powers of
the national life of the period. The star of
Napoleon’s destiny was declining; and the
gigantic struggle begun to bring about the
overthrow of the tyrant of Europe, enlisted
the sympathy and active participation of our
artist.</p>

<p>“To abandon a great undertaking and to remain
as I am! O, what a difference between
the un-industrious life I pictured to myself so
often! O, horrible circumstances which do
not suppress my desire to be thrifty, but which
keep one from being so. O, God! O, God!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
look down on thy unhappy Beethoven. Let
this last no longer as it is.” Thus did he write
in May, 1813, in his diary. Madame Streicher,
interested herself in him in his pecuniary
embarrassment, which was so great that at one
time, he did not have so much as a pair of boots
to leave the house in. He writes: “I do
not deserve to be in the condition I am—the
most unfortunate of my life.” The payments
due him from Kinsky did not come, because
of his sad death, and Prince Lobkowitz’s
love of music and the theater had greatly embarrassed
him financially. Even the giving
of a concert which he contemplated had to be
abandoned in consequence of the bad times.</p>

<p>The idea of a journey to London now took
possession of him all the more strongly because
of the straits to which he was reduced.
This journey was, doubtless, the “great undertaking”
referred to above. It is deserving
of special mention here, because to it we are
indebted for the ninth symphony.</p>

<p>Maelzl, the inventor of the metronome, had
built a panharmonicum, and was anxious to
make the journey to London in company with
Beethoven. He had had the burning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Moscow set for his instrument; and he now
wanted a musical representation of the next
great event of the time—Wellington’s victory
at Vittoria. He suggested the idea to Beethoven.
Beethoven’s hatred of Napoleon and
love of England induced him to adopt it, and
this was the origin of the <i>Schlachtsymphonie</i>
(battle-symphony) op. 91. For, in accordance
with Maelzl’s proposition, he elaborated
what was at first a trumpeter’s piece into an
instrumental composition. It was performed
before a large audience “for the benefit of the
warriors made invalids in the battle of Hanau.”
And—, irony of fate!—a work which Beethoven
himself declared to be a “piece of stupidity,”
took the Viennese by storm, and at a
bound, made him very popular in Vienna.</p>

<p>It was performed on the 12th of December,
1813. The applause was unbounded. All
the best artists of the city were with him.
Salieri, Hummel, Moscheles, Schuppanzigh,
Mayseder, and even strangers like Meyerbeer,
assisted him. The Seventh Symphony was the
ideal foundation of the entire production, for
that symphony was the expression of the
awakening of the heroic spirit of the nation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Anton Schindler, of whom we have already
spoken more than once, and of whom we shall
have more to say in the sequel, as Beethoven’s
companion, writes: “All hitherto dissenting
voices, with the exception of a few professors
of music, finally agreed that he was worthy of
the laurel crown.” He rightly calls the production
of this piece one of the most important
events in Beethoven’s life; for now the portals
of the temple of fame were opened wide to receive
him; and if he had had nothing “nobler
or better” than this to do in life, he certainly
would never again feel the want of the good
things of this world.</p>

<p>His next concern was to turn the occasion
of the moment to advantage, to give some concerts
with <i>Wellington’s Victory</i>, and thus obtain
leisure to work. Pieces from the “Ruins
of Athens” also were played at these concerts.
The success of one aria in particular from that
composition suggested to one of the singers
of the court-opera the idea of reviving
the <i>Fidelio</i>. It then received the form in
which we have it to-day. And what a hold
the character of Leonore still had on our
artist’s soul, we learn from the account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
dramatic poet, Treitschke, who again tried to
abridge the text. He had given expression
to the last flash of life in the scene in Florestein’s
dungeon, in the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Und spür’ ich nicht linde, sanft säuselnde Luft?</div>
<div class="indent">Und ist nicht mein Grab mir erhellet?</div>
<div class="verse">Und seh’, wie ein Engel im rosigen Duft</div>
<div class="indent">Sich tröstend zur Seite mir stellet,</div>
<div class="verse">Ein Engel, Leonoren, der Gattin so gleich,</div>
<div class="verse">Der führt mich zur Freiheit ins himmlische Reich.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“What I now tell you,” he continues, “will
never fade from my memory. Beethoven
came to me in the evening. He read, ran up
and down the room, murmured, growled, as
he usually did instead of singing, and tore
open the pianoforte. My wife had frequently
begged him in vain to play. To-day he
placed the text before him and began playing
wonderful melodies, which unfortunately no
charm could preserve. The hour passed.
Beethoven, however, continued his improvisation.
Supper was served but he would allow
no one to disturb him. It grew quite late.
He then put his arms about me and hurried
home. A few days after the piece was
finished.”</p>

<p>At this time he wrote to Brunswick: “My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
kingdom is in the air. My soul trills as the
winds warble;” to Treitschke: “In short
I assure you, the opera will win the crown of
martyrdom for me.” Thus Leonore’s sorrows
and victory found expression a second time;
for now the so-called <i>Fidelio</i> overture (E major)
was composed. At its performance on the
23d of May, 1814, Beethoven was after the
very first act, enthusiastically called for and
enthusiastically greeted. The applause increased
with every succeeding performance.</p>

<p>Beethoven was now one of the best known
characters in Vienna. He had, even before
this, given several concerts of his own, and at
several others music composed by him had
been performed. His picture by Letronne
appeared at this time. “It is as natural as
life,” said Dr. Weissenbach. He had, on the
26th of September, received with his music of
the <i>Fidelio</i>, the assemblage of monarchs who
had come to attend the Congress of Vienna;
and what was more natural than that he
should now greet them with something new
in the nature of festal music? He did this
with the cantata, <i>Der glorreiche Augenblick</i>
(“the glorious moment”) op. 136. The production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
of it took place in the ever memorable
Academy, on the 29th of November, 1814,
when Beethoven, before a “parterre of kings,”
and what was more, before the educated of
Europe, by the mere assistance of his art,
helped celebrate the solemn moment which
did away with oppression and tyranny and
marked the beginning of a new and happier
period. His audience was numbered by
thousands, and “the respectful absence of all
loud signs of applause gave the whole the
character of worship. Every one seemed to
feel that never again would there be such a
moment in his life.” This extract is from
Schindler’s account, yet, at certain places “the
ecstasy of all present found expression in the
loudest applause, applause which drowned the
powerful accompaniment of the composer.”
The <i>Schlachtsymphonie</i> (battle-symphony) as
well as the seventh symphony, contributed to
the achievement of this victory. After it was
over, he wrote to the archduke: “I am still
exhausted by fatigue, vexation, pleasure and
joy.” But to get an idea of the overpowering
impression made on him by those days, we
must refer to his diary of the following spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
when all that he had then experienced took a
definite form in his feelings and consciousness.
He then writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“May all my life be sacrificed to the sublime. May
it be a sanctuary of art.... Let me live, even
if I have to have recourse to ‘assistance,’ and such
means can be found. Let the ear apparatus be perfected
if possible, and then travel! This you owe to
man and the Almighty. Only thus can you develop
what is locked up within you. The court of a prince,
a little orchestra to write music for, and to produce it,
for the honor of the Almighty, the Eternal, the Infinite.
Thus may my last years pass away, and to
future humanity....”</p>
</div>

<p>He breaks off here as if he did not need to
express an opinion on what he aimed at achieving
and left after him as an inheritance. But
the reputation which he had acquired is correctly
described as “one of the greatest ever
won by a musician.” And now, more than
ever before, he was the object of universal
attention, especially at the brilliant entertainments
given by the Russian ambassador, count
Rasumowsky, to the monarchs present, on one
of which occasions he was presented to them.
The Empress of Russia wished to pay him a
special “compliment.” She did so at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
palace of Archduke Rudolph, who thus helped
celebrate the triumph of his honored teacher.
At a court concert on the 25th of January,
1815, he accompanied the <i>Adelaide</i> for Florestan
Wild himself; and Schindler closes his
account of it with the words: “The great
master recalled those days with much feeling,
and with a certain pride once said that he
had made the great pay their court to him,
and that with them he had always preserved his
dignity.” He thus verified what, as we saw
alone, he had said to Goethe: “You must let
them clearly understand what they possess in
you.”</p>

<p>The “assistance” he longed for came in the
form of presents from monarchs, especially of
the “magnanimous” one of the Empress of
Russia, for whom he, at that time, wrote the
polonaise, op. 89. These presents enabled him
to make a permanent investment of twenty
thousand marks, which his friends were very
much surprised to find he owned, after his
death. But, although by “decree” he drew
yearly the sum of 2,700 marks, his principal
source of income continued to be derived from
his intellectual labor; for his dearly beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
brother Karl died and left him, as an inheritance,
so to speak, his eight-year-old son, named
after his father—the mother not being a fit
person to take care of the child, and, besides,
not enjoying the best of reputations. Beethoven’s
struggles for his “son,” <i>the unfortunate
nephew</i>, with the mother, whom he was wont
to call the “queen of the night,” filled the next
succeeding years of his life with legal controversies
and negotiations to such an extent
that they seem to have hindered him in his
work. Extreme trouble of mind, brought
about by the social and political degeneration
of Vienna immediately after the Congress, soon
entirely obscured the lustre of the days we
have just described; and it was only for short
moments of time, as on the occasion of the
celebrated concert of the year 1824, that we
see his old pride and fame revive. The works
performed at that concert were the <i>Missa Solemnis</i>
and the Ninth Symphony. The former
was a token of gratitude and devotion to the
Archduke Rudolph, but at the same time a
reflection of the soul of the artist himself as we
have heard him describe it above. The symphony
was written “for London;” whither in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
these saddening times his eyes were directed,
and which, although he never undertook the
contemplated journey thither, became the incentive
to the composition of many important
works.</p>

<p>Among the works which date from 1814
and 1815, we may mention the sonata, op. 90,
a “struggle between the head and the heart,”
addressed in the summer of 1814 to Count
Moritz Lichnowsky on the occasion of his marriage
to a Vienna singer; the song <i>Merkenstein</i>
(op. 100), composed in the winter of
1814; Tiedge’s <i>Hoffnung</i> (op. 94), composed
after the last court concert for the singer
Wild; the chorus <i>Meeresstille und Glueckliche
Fahrt</i> (op. 112), which was written in 1815,
and in 1822, “most respectfully dedicated to
the immortal Goethe;” lastly, the magnificent
cello sonatas, op. 102, dedicated to Countess
Erdoedy, who became reconciled with him once
more during this winter, after there had been
a variance between them for a time. He calls
the first of these sonatas the “free sonata,”
and, indeed, freedom now became the characteristic
of his higher artistic pictures. The
<i>adagio</i> of the second discloses to us, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
choral-like construction of its theme, the prevailing
religious direction taken by his
thoughts, which is also apparent in very many
expressions and quotations to be found in his
diary.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the <i>Liederkreis</i>,
op. 98. Beethoven worked at it and at the
sonata op. 101 at the same time. The latter,
an expression of the deepest poetry of the
soul, was ready the following year, and was
dedicated to Madame von Ertmann, his “dear
Dorothea Caecilia,” who, because she thoroughly
understood the meaning of Beethoven’s
music, became a real propagandist of his compositions
for the piano. In 1831, Mendelssohn
could say that he had “learned much” from
her deeply expressive execution. The noble
lady had lost her only son during the absence
of her husband in the wars of emancipation;
and Beethoven had rescued her from a condition
of mind bordering on melancholy, by
coming to her and playing for her until she
burst into tears. “The spell was broken.”
“We finite creatures with an infinite mind are
born only for suffering and for joy; and we
might almost say that the best of human kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
obtain joy only through their sorrow.” Thus
spoke Beethoven to Countess Erdoedy, and
this little incident confirms its truth. His
own sufferings gave our artist the tones of his
musical creations, and these creations were to
him “the dearest gift of heaven,” and, as it
were, a consolation from on high.</p>

<p>But to continue our biography.</p>

<p>When, after a violent contest with the
mother, he was made sole guardian of his
nephew, and could then call him his own, he
seems, as a lady whose diary is embodied in
the little book <i>Eine stille Liebe zu Beethoven</i>,
informs us, to gain new life. He devoted
himself heart and soul to the boy, and he
wrote, or was unable to write, according as the
care of his nephew brought him joy or sorrow.
We can readily understand how it came to
pass that he now penned the words found by
the lady just mentioned, in a memorandum
book of his: “My heart overflows at the
aspect of the beauties of nature—and this
without her.” His “distant loved one” was
still to him the most valued possession of his
life—more to him, even, than himself.</p>

<p>He had now in view several great projects—among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
them an opera, <i>Romulus</i>, by Treitschke,
and an oratorio for the recently founded “Society
of the Friends of Music,” in Vienna.
The latter failed, through the niggardliness of
the directors, and the former was not finished,
although our artist never gave up the intention
of completing it. In the autumn of 1816, an
English general, Kyd, asked Beethoven to
write a symphony, for two hundred ducats.
But as the general wanted it written in the
style of his earlier works, Beethoven himself
refused to accept the commission. Yet this
narrow English enthusiast had excited Beethoven’s
imagination with glowing accounts of
the harvest of profit he might reap in England,
and as Beethoven had recently sold many of
his works there, and as, besides, the new
“Philharmonic Society” had handsomely remunerated
him for these overtures, his intention
of crossing the Channel began to assume
a more definite form. His <i>Schlachtsymphonie</i>
(battle-symphony), especially, had already met
with a very flattering reception in England.
And a project was on foot in that country, even
now, to give him a “benefit” by the production
of his own works; and such a “benefit”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
was actually given for him there when he was
on his death-bed. He wrote in 1816 that it
would flatter him to be able to write some new
works, such as symphonies and an oratorio, for
the Society which embraced a greater number
of able musicians than almost any other in
Europe.</p>

<p>His diary covering this period to 1818, published
in the work <i>Die Beethovenfeier und die
deutsche Kunst</i>, because of the many items of
interest it has in it, contains these characteristic
lines: “Drop operas and everything else.
Write only in your own style.” But even the
sketches of the Seventh Symphony had the remark
accompanying them: “2. Symphony in
D minor,” and those of the eighth: “Symphony
in D minor—3. Symphony.” Belonging to
the years succeeding 1812, we find drafts of the
<i>scherzo</i> of the Ninth Symphony. The headings
above given undoubtedly had reference to this
last, but the sketches of the first movement,
decisive of the character of such a work, are
not to be found until the year 1816, but then
they are found with the physiognomy so masculine
and so full of character which distinguishes
this “symphony for London.” He once said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of Englishmen that they were, for the most
part, “clever fellows;” and he—of whom
Zelter wrote to Goethe, that “he must have
had a man for his mother”—felt that, in England,
he, as a man, had to do with men, and,
as an artist, to enter the list with Handel,
whose own powerful influence was due to his
decided manfulness of character. And then,
had not England produced a tragic poet like
Shakespeare, whom Beethoven loved above all
others? Deep, tragic earnestness, and a masculine
struggle with fate, are here the fundamental
tone and design of the whole. “And
then a cowl when thou closest thy unhappy
life”—such is the conclusion of the lines
quoted above, in which he says that he must
write “only in his own style.”</p>

<p>And now, in July, 1817, came from London
the “direct commission” he had so long endeavored
to obtain. The Society desired
to send him a proof of their esteem and
gratitude for the many happy moments his
works had given them to enjoy, and invited
him to come to London to write two great
symphonies, promising him an honorarium of
three hundred pounds sterling. Beethoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
immediately accepted the commission, and
assured them that he would do his very best
to execute it—honorable as it was to him, and
coming as it did from so select a society of
artists—in the worthiest manner possible.
He promised to go to work immediately.
“He believed that he could nowhere receive
the distinction which his gigantic genius—in
advance of his age by several centuries—deserved,
as he could in Great Britain. The
respect shown him by the English people,
he valued more than that of all Europe
besides. The feeling he had of his own
powers may, indeed, have contributed to make
him prefer the English nation to all others,
especially as they showered so many marks of
distinction on him.” Thus writes one of his
most intimate friends in Vienna, Baron Von
Zmeskall, already mentioned; and certain it
is that he did his very best on this work. It,
as well as the symphony in C minor, is of
the true Beethoven type—more so, perhaps,
than any other of his works—the full picture
of his own personal existence and of the
tragedy of human life in general. This work
was followed by the Tenth Symphony, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“poetical idea,” at least, of which we know.
The first movement was intended to represent
a “feast of Bacchus,” the <i>adagio</i> a <i>cantique
ecclesiastique</i>, a church hymn, and the <i>finale</i>
the reconciliation of the antique world, which
he esteemed so highly with the spirit of
Christianity, into the full depth of which he
came to have a deeper insight every day that
passed. We see that he had lofty plans, and
that no poet ever soared to sublimer heights
than he. We must bear these great plans
and labors of Beethoven in mind if we would
rightly understand his subsequent life—if we
would comprehend how, in the desolate and
distracted existence he was compelled henceforth
to lead, he did not become a victim of
torpidity, but that, on the contrary, the elasticity
of his genius grew greater and greater,
and that his creations gained both in depth
and perfection.</p>

<p>Thus do we see with our own eyes at least
one of his works born of his own life.</p>

<p>The songs <i>Ruf von Berge</i> and <i>So oder so</i>,
were composed in the winter of 1816-17; and
in the following spring, after the sudden death
of one of his friends, the chorus <i>Rasch tritt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
der Tod</i>, from Schiller’s Tell. “O God, help
me! Thou seest me forsaken by all mankind.
O hard fate, O cruel destiny! No, no, no,
my unhappy condition will never end. Thou
hast no means of salvation but to leave here.
Only by so doing canst thou rise to the height
of thy art. Here thou art immersed in vulgarity.
Only one symphony, and then away,
away, away!” Thus does he write in his
diary. He next, in 1817, finished the quintet
fugue, op. 137, and, in 1818, the great
sonata for the Hammer-clavier, op. 106. The
<i>adagio</i> of the latter is the musical expression
of earnest prayer to God. Its first movement
shows how he had soared once more to the
heights of his art. “The sonata was written
under vexatious circumstances,” he says to his
friend Ries; and to a younger fellow-artist,
the composer Schnyder von Wartensee: “Go
on. There is no calmer, more unalloyed or
purer joy than that which arises from ascending
higher and higher into the heaven
of art.” Such, too, was his mood in those
days when he promised his friend Zmeskall
the trio for the piano in C minor, his op. 1,
worked over into the quintet op. 104; for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
wrote: “I rehearse getting nearer the grave,
without music, every day.” In keeping with
this is the song, <i>Lisch aus, mein Licht</i>, “Put
out my light,” which also belongs to this
period. The supplication: “O hear me always,
Thou unspeakable One, hear me, thy
unhappy creature, the most unfortunate of all
mortals,” found in his diary, belongs to this
same time. It is now easy to see that he was
in a very suitable frame of mind when he
resolved, in 1818, to write a solemn mass for
the occasion of the inauguration of his distinguished
pupil as Archbishop of Olmutz.
It was the “little court,” the “little orchestra”
for which he wished to write the music “for
the honor of the Almighty, the Eternal, the
Infinite;” for the Archduke thought of making
him his <i>capellmeister</i> there. After four years’
labor, the <i>Missa Solemnis</i>, op. 123, was finished.
Beethoven called it “<i>l’œuvre le plus
accompli</i>, my most finished work.” And, like
the <i>Fidelio</i>, it is deserving of this characterization,
but more on account of the pains
taken with it and the labor expended on it
than of its matter.</p>

<p>“Sacrifice again all the trivialties of social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
life to thy art. O, God above all! For Providence
eternal omnisciently orders the happiness
or unhappiness of mortal men.” With
these words from the Odyssey, he resolved
to consecrate himself to this great work.
And it was a resolve in very deed. For, as
in opera, he knew that he was here bound
by traditionary forms—forms which, indeed,
in some details afforded rich food to his own
thoughts, but which, on the whole, hindered
the natural flow of his fancy. We now
approach a period in Beethoven’s life in
which he was strangely secluded from the
world. The painter, Kloeber, the author of
the best known portrait of Beethoven, and
which is to be found in <i>Beethoven’s Brevier</i>—it
was painted during the summer of 1818—once
saw him throw himself under a fir
tree and look for a longtime “up into the
heavens.” In some of the pages of his written
conversations—for it was now necessary for him
to have recourse to putting his conversations
on paper more frequently on account of his increasing
deafness—he wrote in the winter of
1819-20: “Socrates and Jesus were patterns
to me;” and after that: “The moral law within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
us and the starry heavens above us.—Kant!!!”
Just as on the 4th of March, 1820, he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ernte bald an Gottes Thron</div>
<div class="verse">Meiner Leiden schoenen Lohn.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This was the time of the struggles with the
mother of his “son” and of the heartfelt sorrow
he had to endure on account of the moral
ruin of the poor boy himself, who, always
going from the one to the other, did not really
know to whom he belonged, and who, therefore,
deceived both. “From the heart—may
it in turn appeal to hearts!” He wrote these
words on the score of the mass; and Schindler,
who was now his companion, says that
“the moment he began this work his whole
nature seemed to change.” He would sit in
the eating-house sunk in deep thought, forget
to order his meals, and then want to pay for
them. “Some say he is a fool,” wrote Zelter
to Goethe in 1819. And Schindler tells us
“he actually seemed possessed in those days,
especially when he wrote the fugue and the
<i>Benedictus</i>.” That fugue, <i>Et vitam senturi</i>
(life everlasting!) is the climax of the work,
since the depiction of the imperishableness
and inexhaustibleness of Being was what Beethoven’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
powerful mind was most used to.
The wonderful <i>Benedictus</i>, (Blessed is he who
cometh in the name of the Lord) whose tones
seem to float down from heaven to earth, the
bestowal of help from on high, was subsequently
the model used by Wagner for his
descent of the Holy Grail, the symbol of divine
grace, in the prelude to the <i>Lohengrin</i>.
“When I recall his state of mental excitement,
I must confess that I never before, and never
after this period of his complete forgetfulness
of earth, observed anything like it in him.”
So says Schindler. They had gone to visit
him in Baden, near by, whither he repaired
in the interest of his health, and where he
loved so well to “wander through the quiet
forest of firs” and think out his works. It
was four o’clock in the afternoon. The door
was closed, and they could hear him “singing,
howling, stamping” at the fugue. After they
had listened to this “almost horrible” scene,
the door opened, and Beethoven stood before
them, with trouble depicted on his countenance.
He looked as if he had just gone
through a struggle of life and death. “Pretty
doings here; everybody is gone, and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
not eaten a morsel since yesterday noon,” he
said. He had worked the previous evening
until after midnight; and so the food had
grown cold and the servants left in disgust.</p>

<p>His work assumed greater and greater dimensions
as he himself gradually rose to the
full height of the subject. He no longer
thought of completing it for the installation
ceremonies. It became a grand fresco painting—a
symphony in choruses on the words
of the mass. He now began to work more
calmly, and to compose at intervals other
works, in order to quiet his over-excited mind
and to earn a living for his “dear” nephew.
And thus, while he was composing his mass, he
produced not only the <i>Variirten Themen</i>, op.
105 and 107, which Thompson, of Edinburg—who
had sent Beethoven the Scotch songs
like op. 108 to be arranged—had ordered, but
also the three <i>Last Sonatas</i>, op. 109, dedicated
to Bettina’s niece, Maximiliane Brentano, to
whose excellent father he was indebted for
ready assistance during these years of his
pecuniary embarrassment; also op. 110, which
was finished at Christmas, 1821, as op. 111
was on the 13th of January, 1822. It is said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
that he entertained a higher opinion himself
of these sonatas than of his previous ones.
They are greatly superior, however, only in
some of their movements; and they are written
in the grand, free style of that period, especially
the <i>arietta</i> in the last opus, the variations
of which are real pictures of his own
soul. In the intervals between them, however,
we find some trifles such as the <i>Bagatellen</i>,
op. 119, which his pecuniary condition
made it imperative he should compose, since,
“as a brave knight by his sword, he had to
live by his pen.” And even the “<i>33 Veraenderungen</i>”
(variations), op. 120, on the works
of Diabelli, of the year 1822-23, are more the
intellectual play of the inexhaustible fancy of
an artist than the work of the genuine gigantic
creative power which Beethoven undoubtedly
possessed. He had overtaxed his strength
working on the mass, and thus exhausted it
for a moment. The two chorus-songs, op.
121<sup>b</sup> and op. 122, the <i>Opferlied</i> and <i>Bundeslied</i>,
which date from the year 1822-23, bear
the stamp of occasional compositions, which
they, in fact, are.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the lion had roused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
himself again. He now only needed to give
the finishing touch to the Mass, and in the
spring of 1823 the entire work was completed.
The summer of 1822 found him fully engaged
on the composition of that monument
to his genius, the Ninth Symphony. Freedom
from the torment of exhausting labor, and the
entire surrender of himself to “his own style,”
gave his fancy back its old elasticity and all
its productive power. Scarcely any year of
his life was more prolific of works than this
year 1822.</p>

<p>“Our Beethoven seems again to take a
greater interest in music, which, since the
trouble with his hearing began to increase, he
avoided almost as a woman-hater avoids the
sex. To the great pleasure of all, he improvised
a few tunes in a most masterly manner.”
Thus do we read in the Leipzig <i>Musikzeitung</i>,
in the spring of 1822, and the Englishman,
John Russell, gives us a charming description
of such an evening in the Cotta <i>Beethovenbuch</i>.
Weisse’s droll poem, <i>Der Kuss</i> (the kiss) op.
128, is found among the serious sketches of
this year. And now he received a whole
series of commissions. An English captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
named Reigersfeld, wanted a quartet, and
Breitkopf and Haertel an operatic poem worthy
of his art, before he “hung up his harp
forever.” Others asked for other kinds of
music. “In short,” he writes to his brother
Johann, “people are fighting to get works from
me, happy, unhappy man that I am. If my
health is good, I shall yet be able to feather
my nest.” Friederich Rochlitz brought him,
too, a commission from Breitkopf and Haertel
to write “music for Faust.” Rochlitz gives
us a very interesting account of Beethoven’s
appearance and whole mode of life at this
time. Not Beethoven’s neglected, almost savage
exterior, he says, not his bushy black
hair, which hung bristling about his head,
would have stirred him; what stirred him was
the whole appearance of the deaf man who,
notwithstanding his infirmity, brought joy to
the hearts of millions—pure, intellectual joy.
But when he received the commission, he
raised his hand high up and exclaimed:
“That might be worth while. But I have
been intending for some time to write three
other great works—two great symphonies, very
different from each other, and an oratorio. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
shudder at the thought of beginning works of
such magnitude. But once engaged on them,
I shall find no difficulty.” He spoke of the
Ninth Symphony, to which he had now begun
to give the finishing touches, in all earnestness.</p>

<p>This was interrupted for a short time by
the overture, <i>Zur Weihe des Hauses</i> (op. 124),
for the opening of the renovated Josephstadt
theater with the “Ruins of Athens,” of 1812.
It is the portal to the temple in which art is
praised as something consecrated to the service
of mankind—as a thing which may lift
us for blissful moments into the region of the
purifying and elevating influences of higher
powers. Even in this work, which dates from
September, 1822, we may hear the solemn
sound and rhythm of the Ninth Symphony.
And, indeed, after a memorandum on the
“Hungarian Story,” we find in the sketches
of it the words, “Finale, <i>Freude schoener Goetterfunken</i>,”
together with the wonderfully simple
melody itself, which sounds to humanity’s
better self like the music of its own redemption.
Beethoven’s own nature was deeply
moved at this time. Weber’s <i>Freischuetz</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
with Wilhelmine Schroeder, afterwards so
celebrated, had excited the greatest enthusiasm.
Rossini’s reception in Vienna was “like
an opeotheosis;” and Beethoven was determined
to let the light of his genius shine forth,
which he could do only by writing a work
“in his own style.” The world was “his for
another evening,” and he was anxious to turn
that evening to account. And, indeed, had
he not a world of sorrows to paint—sorrows
which actual life had brought to him? He
had also a world of joys—joys vouchsafed to
him by his surrendering of himself to a higher
life.</p>

<p>An incident which occurred during this fall
of 1822 tells us something of this gloomy night
of his personal existence. Young Schroeder-Devrient,
encouraged by her success with
<i>Pamina</i> and <i>Agathe</i>, had chosen the <i>Fidelio</i>
for her benefit, and Beethoven himself was to
wield the baton. Schindler tells us how, even
during the first scene of the opera, everything
was in confusion, but that no one cared to
utter the saddening words: “It’s impossible
for you, unfortunate man.” Schindler finally,
in response to Beethoven’s own questioning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
wrote something to that effect down. In a
trice, Beethoven leaped into the parterre, saying
only: “Quick, out of here!” He ran
without stopping to his dwelling, threw himself
on the sofa, covered his face with his two
hands, and remained in that position until
called to table. But, even at table, he did not
utter a word. He sat at it, the picture of the
deepest melancholy. Schindler’s account of
the incident closes thus: “In all my experience
with Beethoven, this November day is
without a parallel. It mattered not what disappointments
or crosses misfortune brought
him, he was ill-humored only for moments,
sometimes depressed. He would, however,
soon be himself again, lift his head proudly,
walk about with a firm step, and rule in the
workshop of his genius. But he never fully
recovered from the effect of this blow.”</p>

<p>The performance itself brought out, for
the first time, in all its completeness, musico-dramatic
art, in the representation of the
scene, “Kill first his wife.” Richard Wagner,
who has so highly developed this musico-dramatic
art, admits that he acquired the real
idea of plastic shaping for the stage from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Schroeder-Devrient. To it, also, Beethoven,
owed it that he was invited, during the same
winter (1822-23), to compose a new opera. It
was Grillparzer’s <i>Melusine</i>, but the intention
to compose it was never carried into effect.</p>

<p>We have now reached the zenith of the
life of Beethoven as an artist. Besides the
Ninth Symphony, he finished only the five
last quartets which beam in their numerous
movements like “the choir of stars about the
sun.” The welcome incentive to the composition
of these last came to him just at this time
from the Russian, Prince Gallitizin, who gave
him a commission to write them, telling him
at the same time to ask what remuneration he
wished for his work. But the Symphony filled
up the next following year, 1823. Nothing
else, except the “fragmentary ideas” of the
<i>Bagatellen</i>, op. 126, engaged him during that
time.</p>

<p>“To give artistic form only to what we
wish and feel, that most essential want of the
nobler of mankind,” it is, as he wrote himself
to the Archduke at this time, that distinguishes
this mighty symphony, and constitutes,
so to speak, the sum and substance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
his own life and intuition. This symphony
was soon connected in popular imagination
with Goethe’s Faust, as representing the tragic
course of human existence.</p>

<p>And when we hear in mind how closely
related just here the musician was to the poet,
this interpretation of the work, given first by
Richard Wagner on the occasion of its presentation
in 1846 in Dresden, seems entirely
warranted. What was there of which life had
not deprived him? The words it had always
addressed to him were these words from Faust:
<i>Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren</i> (renounce
thou must, thou must renounce). He now
wished to paint a full picture of this vain
struggle with relentless fate in tones, and what
he had just gone through in his own experience
enabled him to do it in living colors. All
the recollections of his youth crowded upon
him. There were the “pretty lively blonde”
whom he had met in Bonn; Countess Giulietta,
who had a short time before returned
to Bonn with her husband; and his “distant
loved one” in Berlin! A promenade through
the lovely Heiligenstadt valley, in the spring
of 1823, brought to his mind anew pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of the reconciling power of nature, as well as
of the <i>Pastorale</i> and the C minor symphony.
He was now able to form an idea of their
common meaning, and to put an interpretation
on them very different from his first idea and
first interpretation of them. He began to have
a much deeper insight into the ultimate questions
and enigmas of existence.</p>

<p>But, all of a sudden, his humor left him.
He refused to receive any visitors. “Samothracians,
come not here; bring no one to me,”
he wrote to Schindler, from the scene of his
quiet life in the country. What had never
happened before, even when he was in the
highest stages of intellectual exaltation, now
came to pass: he repeatedly returned from his
wanderings through the woods and fields without
his hat. “There is nothing higher than
to approach nearer to the Deity than other
men, and from such proximity to spread the
rays of the Deity among the human race.”
In these words, directed to the Archduke
Rudolph, he summed up his views of his art
and what he wished to accomplish in it. It
was everything to him—a language, consolation,
admonition, light and prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>This we learn most clearly from the Ninth
Symphony, which he finished at this time, in
Baden.</p>

<p>From the dark abyss of nothing arises the
Will, infinite Will: and with it the struggles
and the sorrow of life. But it is no longer
personal sorrow—for what is personal sorrow
compared with the sorrow of the world as
known to a great mind, experienced by a great
heart?—it is the struggle for a higher existence
which we “mortals have to engage in
against the infinite spirit.” “Many a time
did I curse my Creator because he has made
his creatures the victims of the merest accidents.”
Cries of anguish and anger like this—the
cries of great souls whose broad vision is
narrowed by the world, and whose powerful
will is hampered—find utterance here. “I
shall take fate by the jaws,” he says again,
and how immense is the struggle as well as
the consciousness of a higher, inalienable possession,
which lives as a promise in the breasts
of all! Such blows, murmurs, prayers, longings,
such despair; and then, again, such
strength and courage after trial, had never
before been expressed in music. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Ninth Symphony, we hear the voices of the
powers which through all ages have been the
makers of history; of the powers which preserve
and renovate the life of humanity; and
so the Will, the Intellect, man, after a terrible
effort and concentration of self, stands firmly
before us, bold and clear-eyed—for Will is
the world itself.</p>

<p>But when we see the man Beethoven, we
find him divided against himself. We have
often heard him say that he found the world
detestable; and we shall again hear him express
his opinion on that subject plainly
enough, in this his work.</p>

<p>In the second movement, which he himself
calls only <i>allegro vivace</i>, and which, indeed, is
no <i>scherzo</i>, not even a Beethoven-like one,
but rather a painting, we have a dramatic
picture of the earthly world in the whirl of
its pleasures, from the most ingenuous joy of
mere existence—such as he himself frequently
experienced in such fullness that he leaped
over chairs and tables—to the raging, uncontrollable
Bacchanalian intoxication of enjoyment.
But we have in it also a fresco painting
of the “dear calmness of life,” of joy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the existing, of exultation and jubilation as
well as of the demoniacal in sensuous life and
pleasure. But what nutriment and satisfaction
this splendid symphony affords to a noble
mind! It carries such a man from the arms of
pleasure to “the stars,” from art to nature,
from appearance to reality.</p>

<p>This ideal kingdom of the quiet, sublime
order of the world, which calms our minds
and senses, and expresses our infinite longings,
is heard in the <i>adagio</i> of the work. And
when, in an incomparably poetical union to
the quiet course of the stars and to the eternally
ordered course of things, the longing,
perturbed human heart is contrasted by a
second melody, with a wealth of inner beauty
never before imagined, we at last see the soul,
so to speak, disappear entirely before itself,
dissolved in the sublimity of the All. The
steps of time, expressed by the rhythm of the
final chords, sound like the death knell of the
human heart. Its wants and wishes are silenced
in the presence of such sublimity, and sink to
naught.</p>

<p>But the world is man, is the heart, and
wants to live, to live! And so here the final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
echo is still the longing, sounding tones of
human feeling.</p>

<p>Beethoven himself tells us the rest of the
development of this powerful tragedy, and
thus confirms the explanation of it we have
given, as well as the persistence of ultimate
truth in his own heart; for in it we find—after
the almost raging cry of all earthly existence
in the orchestral storm of the beginning of
the <i>finale</i>, which was even then called a “feast
of scorn at all that is styled human joy”—in
the sketches, as text to the powerful recitatives
of the contra-bassos: “No, this confusion reminds
us of our despairing condition. This is
a magnificent day. Let us celebrate it with
song.” And then follows the theme of the
first movement: “O no, it is not this; it is
something else that I am craving.” “The will
and consciousness of man are at variance the
one with the other, and the cause of man’s
despairing situation.” Next comes the <i>motive</i>
for the <i>scherzo</i>: “Nor is it this thing either;
it is but merriness and small talk”—the trifles
of sensuous pleasure. Next comes the theme of
the <i>adagio</i>: “Nor is it this thing either,” and
thereupon the words: “I myself shall sing—music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
must console us, music must cheer us;”
and then the melody, <i>Freude schoener Goetterfunken</i>,
is heard, expressive of the newly-won
peace of the soul, descriptive of human
character in the full beauty of its simplicity
and innocence restored. Beethoven knew from
what depths of human nature music was born,
and what its ultimate meaning to mankind is.</p>

<p>We are made to experience this more fully
still by the continuation of the <i>finale</i> which
represents the solution of the conflict of this
tragedy of life. For the “joy” that is here
sung plainly springs from its only pure and
lasting source, from the feeling of all-embracing
love—that feeling which, as religion, fills
the heart. The <i>Ihr stuerzt nieder, Millionen</i>
is the foundation, the germ (to express it in
the language of music of double counterpoint)
of the <i>Seid umschlungen, Millionen</i>,
and then the whole sings of joy as the transfiguration
of the earthly world by eternal love.
The will can accomplish nothing greater than
to sacrifice itself for the good of the whole.
To our great artist, the greatest and most wonderful
phenomenon in the world was not the
conqueror but the overcomer of the world;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and he knew that this spirit of love cannot die.</p>

<p>This is celebrated by the <i>finale</i> as the last
consequence of the “struggle with fate,” of
man’s life-struggle. Is it claiming too much
to say that out of the spirit of this music a
“new civilization” and an existence more
worthy of human beings might be developed,
since it leads us back to the foundation and
source of civilization and human existence—to
religion? Beethoven was one of those
great minds who have added to the intellectual
possessions of our race in regions which extend
far beyond the merely beautiful in art.
When we bear this in mind, we can understand
why he wanted to write a tenth symphony
as the counterpart and final representation
of these highest conceptions of the nature
and goal of our race. This tenth symphony
he intended should transfigure the merely humanly
beautiful of the antique world in the
light of the refined humanity of modern ideas—the
earthly in the light of the heavenly. And
we may understand, too, what we are told of
himself, that as soon as cheerfulness beamed
in his countenance, it shed about him all the
charms of childlike innocence. “When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
smiled,” we are told, “people believed not
only in him, but in humanity.” Occasionally
there would blossom on his lips a smile which
those who saw could find no other word to describe
but “heavenly.” So full was his heart
of hearts of the highest treasure of humanity.</p>

<p>We shall see how the last quartets, which
follow now, represent this, his sublime transfigured
condition of soul, in the most varied
pictures, and disclose it to the very bottom.</p>

<p>Of works composed during this period, we
may mention: March to “Tarpeja” and the
<i>Bardengeist</i> composed in 1813; <i>Gute Nachricht</i>,
<i>Elegischer Gesang</i>, <i>Kriegers Abschied</i>,
composed in 1814; Duos for the clarionette and
bassoon, which appeared in 1815; <i>Es ist vollbracht</i>,
<i>Sehnsucht</i>, Scotch songs, composed in
1815; <i>Der Mann von Wort</i>, op. 99. <i>Militaermarsch</i>,
composed in 1816; quintet op. 104
(after op. 1, III), composed in 1817; <i>Clavierstueck</i>
in B, composed in 1818; <i>Gratulations-menuet</i>,
composed in 1822. It will be noticed
that the number of his works grows steadily
smaller according as their volume or their
depth of meaning grows greater. This last will
be evident especially from his subsequent quartets
which, so to speak, stand entirely alone.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Noble</span> souls fall usually only because they
do not know the mournful but incontestable
truth that, considering our present customs
and political institutions, the artist has more
to suffer in proportion as he is a genuine artist.
The more original and gigantic his
works are, the more severely is he punished
for the effects they produce. The swifter and
sublimer his thoughts, the more does he vanish
from the dim vision of the multitude.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Thus did Beethoven’s direct successor in art,
Hector Berlioz, complain at the end of his
days; and to whom can what he says here be
applied with more propriety than to our artist,
especially at this period of his life, when his
thoughts took their sublimest flight? His
action now seemed indeed to assure him unconditional
victory, even in his immediate
environment—we are approaching the celebrated
concert of May, 1824—but how soon
shall we see him again misunderstood by the
crowd and, as a consequence, lonelier than ever
before.</p>

<p>He had again enjoyed to the full the “higher
life which art and science imply, and which
they give it to us to hope for;” and he, in
consequence, became exceedingly neglectful of
himself; so that his brother found it necessary
to say to him: “You must buy yourself a new
hat to-morrow. The people make merry at your
expense because you have so bad a hat.” But
now that the “colossal creation” was finished,
even to the last iota, he began to be in better
humor, to stroll about the streets gazing at the
show-windows, and to salute many an old
friend, as, for instance, his former teacher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Schenk, more warmly. His name was now
more frequently on the lips of friends, and
when it was known that a great symphony, as
well as the Mass, was finished, people recalled
the boundless rapture of the years 1813-14;
and a letter signed by men of the higher
classes of society—men whom Beethoven himself
loved and honored—invited him, in February,
1824, to abstain no longer from the
performance of something great. And, indeed,
the Italian <i>roulade</i> and all kinds of
purely external <i>bravoura</i> had obtained supremacy
in Vienna. The “second childhood of
taste” threatened to follow the “golden age
of art.” It was hoped that home art would
receive new life from Beethoven, who, in his
own sphere, had no equal, and that, thanks to
his influence, the true and the beautiful would
rule supreme again.</p>

<p>Schindler found him with the manuscript
in his hand. “It is very pretty! I am glad!”
Beethoven said, in a very peculiar tone. And
another hope was bound up with this. He
hoped to obtain compensation for his long
labor, and, in this way, leisure to produce
something new worthy of his genius. The preparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
for the concert was attended by very
much that was disagreeable. His own want of
resolution and suspicious manner contributed
their share to this. With the most splenetic
humor, he writes: “After six weeks’ vexation,
I am boiled, stewed, roasted.” And when
several of his more intimate friends, like Count
Lichnowsky, Schuppanzigh and Schindler, resorted
to a little subterfuge to make him come
to some resolve, he said: “I despise deceit.
Visit me no more. And let him visit me no
more. I’m not giving a party.” But, on the
other hand, the first violinists of the city—Schuppanzigh,
Mayseder and Boehm, who is
still living—together with <i>capellmeister</i> Umlauf,
were at the head of the orchestra, while
a large number of amateurs were ready to lend
their assistance at a moment’s notice. Their
motto was: “Anything and everything for
Beethoven!” And thus the preparations for
the performance of Beethoven’s great creations
were begun.</p>

<p>“Just as if there were words beneath them?”
asked Schindler, speaking of the powerful recitatives
of the basses in the Ninth Symphony.
Henriette Sontag and Caroline Unger, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
subsequently so celebrated, found it exceedingly
difficult to execute the solos in the Mass
and the <i>finale</i>; but to all prayers that they
might be changed, Beethoven had only one
answer: “No!” To which Henriette finally
replied: “Well, in God’s name, let us torment
ourselves a little longer, take a little more
trouble, and attempt it.” The performance
was to occur on the 7th of May. That “rare,
noble man,” Brunswick had, as he said, brought
“four ears” with him, that he might not lose a
single note. Frau von Ertmann was again in
Vienna. The boxes were all soon taken, and
many seats were sold at a premium. Beethoven
personally invited the court. His trusted
servant, who was specially helpful to him on
this occasion, said to him: “We shall take
your green coat with us, too; the theater is
dark; no one can see us. O my great master,
not a black dress coat have you in your possession.”
The house was crowded to over-fullness.
Only the court box was almost empty,
on account of the Emperor’s absence. Beethoven’s
attendant again tells us: “His reception
was more than imperial; at the fourth
round of applause, the people became vociferous.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
And Boehm tells us how the tears
rushed into his own and Mayseder’s eyes at
the very beginning. And what a success the
performance was!</p>

<p>In one of the accounts of it that have come
down to us, we read: “Never in my life did
I hear such tempestuous and at the same time
such hearty applause. At one place—where
the kettle-drums so boldly take up the rhythmic
<i>motive</i> alone—the second movement of
the symphony was totally interrupted by the
applause; the tears stood in the eyes of the
performers; Beethoven, however, contrived to
wield the baton until Umlauf called his attention
to the action of the audience by a motion
of his hand. He looked at them and bowed
in a very composed way.” At the close the
applause was greater still. Yet, strange to
say, the man who was the cause of it all again
turned his back to the enthusiastic audience.
At this juncture, the happy thought occurred
to Unger to wheel Beethoven about towards
the audience, and to ask him to notice their
applause with their waving of hats and handkerchiefs.
He testified his gratitude simply
by bowing, and this was the signal for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
breaking forth of a jubilation such as had
scarcely ever before been heard in a theater,
and which it seemed would never end. The
next day, we read, in his conversation leaves,
what some one said to him: “Everybody is
shattered and crushed by the magnitude of
your works.”</p>

<p>And now, what of the pecuniary success of
the performance? It was measured by about
one hundred and twenty marks. The expenses
attending it had been too great. Besides, regular
subscribers, entitled to their seats in boxes,
did not pay a farthing for this concert. The
court did not send in a penny, which, however,
they were wont not to fail to do on the occasion
of the commonest benefits. When Beethoven
reached his home, Schindler handed him the
account of the receipts. “When he saw it, he
broke down entirely. We took him and laid
him on the sofa. We remained at his side
until late in the night. He asked neither for
food nor for anything else. Not an audible
word did he utter. At last, when we observed
that Morpheus had gently closed his eyes, we
retired. His servant found him next morning
in his concert toilette (his green dress coat)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
in the same place, asleep.” This account is
by Schindler, who, together with the young
official, Joseph Huettenbrenner, one of Franz
Schubert’s intimate friends, had taken him
home on this occasion.</p>

<p>This was the first performance of the <i>Missa
Solemnis</i> (op. 123) and of the Ninth Symphony
(op. 125). It took place on the 7th of May,
1824. The fact that when the performance
was repeated on the 24th of May, spite of the
additional attraction of the “adored” tenor,
David, who sang Rossini’s <i>Di tanti palpiti</i>,
(after so much pain), the house was half empty,
shows that, after all, it was more curiosity
to see the celebrated deaf man than real taste
for art which had filled it the first time. Like
Mozart, Beethoven did not live long enough to
pluck even the pecuniary fruits of his genius.
Not till 1845 did the magnanimous liberality
of one who was really permeated by his spirit
bring it to pass that a monument was erected
to him in his native city, Bonn, as that same
liberality has brought it to pass that one has
been erected to him, in our own day, in his
second home, Vienna. We have reference to
the royal gift and to the equally rich playing
of Franz Liszt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>It now became more imperative for him to
give his attention to those compositions which
promised him some immediate return, to the
quartets, to write which he had received a
commission from persons as noted for their
generosity to him as for their love of art.
These and the op. 127 occupy the first
place in this brilliant constellation of art.
“I am not writing what I should prefer
to write. I am writing for the money I
need. When that end is satisfied, I hope
to write what is of most importance to
myself and to art—Faust.” He thus expressed
himself when engaged in the composition
of the Ninth Symphony, and there
was some talk of his writing an “Oratorio for
Boston.” And so, likewise, the German Melusine
and an opera for Naples, the Requiem,
the tenth symphony, and an overture on
B-A-C-H remained projects and no more.
But they were also a great prospect for the future
while he was engaged in the labors of
the day; and they exercised no inconsiderable
influence on the composition of the quartets
themselves. The more he became interested
in these works—and what works were better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
calculated to interest a composer of such poetic
power—the more did these ideas become
interwoven into the works themselves. They
generated the peculiarly grand style and
the monumental character which distinguish
these last quartets. The soul-pictures from
Faust especially are here eloquently re-echoed
in the most sublime monologues. And, indeed,
the Prince, who had given him the commission
to write them, seemed to be the very
man to induce Beethoven to achieve what was
highest and best in art, even in such a narrow
sphere. For he had so arranged it that, even
before its production in Vienna, that “sublime
masterpiece,” the Mass, was publicly performed.
He informs us that the effect on the public
was indescribable; that he had never before
heard anything, not even of Mozart’s music,
which had so stirred his soul; that Beethoven’s
genius was centuries in advance of
his age, and that probably there was not
among his hearers a single one enlightened
enough to take in the full beauty of his music.
On the other hand, there reigned in
Vienna that weak revelry of the period of the
restoration, with its idol Rossini, a revelry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
which had driven all noble and serious music
into the background. Besides, the Prince had
ordered that the costs for musical composition
should be curtailed “to any desired sum.”</p>

<p>Beethoven now went to work in earnest,
and this composition was destined to be his
last.</p>

<p>He had already made a great many drafts
of the works above mentioned, one for op. 127
in the summer of 1822, one for the succeeding
quartet in A minor (op. 131), in the year
1823, when he was completing the Ninth
Symphony. Both op. 127 and the quartet
in A minor remind us, in more ways than
one, of the style of the Ninth Symphony—the
latter by its passion so full of pain, the former,
with its <i>adagio</i>, where the longing glances
to the stars have generated a wonderful,
melancholy peace of soul. The immediately
following third quartet (op. 130) stands out
before us like a newly created world, but one
which is “not of this world.” And, indeed,
the events in Beethoven’s life became calculated
more and more to liberate him, heart
and soul, from this world, and the whole composition
of the quartets appears like a preparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
for the moment when the mind,
released from existence here, feels united with
a higher being. But it is not a painfully
happy longing for death that here finds expression.
It is the heartfelt, certain and
joyful feeling of something really eternal and
holy that speaks to us in the language of a
new dispensation. And even the pictures of
the world here to be found, be they serious or
gay, have this transfigured light—this outlook
into eternity. There is little in the
world of art, in which the nature of the
religious appears so fully in its substance and
essence without showing itself at any time
otherwise than purely human, and therefore
imperishable—never clothed in an accidental
and perishable garb. This explains how a
people not noted for any musical genius, but
who are able to understand the spirit and
meaning of music, the English, whom Beethoven
himself esteemed so highly, considered
his music “so religious.” And, indeed, his
music is religious in its ultimate meaning and
spirit. This character of his music finds its
purest and most striking expression in the last
quartets; and these quartets enable us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
understand the saying of Richard Wagner,
Beethoven’s truest pupil and successor, that
our civilization might receive a new soul from
the spirit of this music, and a renovation of
religion which might permeate it through and
through.</p>

<p>We now pass to an account of the details
of the origin of these works.</p>

<p>The bitterness which Beethoven was destined
henceforth to taste proceeded for the
most part from his own relatives. “God is
my witness, my only dream is to get away
entirely from you, from my miserable brother,
and from this despicable family which has
been tied to me,” he writes, in 1825, to his
growing nephew. We cannot refrain from
touching on these sad things, because now,
especially, they exercised the greatest influence
on his mind and on his pecuniary circumstances,
and because they finally led to a
catastrophe which played a part in bringing
about his premature death.</p>

<p>His weak and “somewhat money-loving”
brother, Johann, had, indeed, in consequence
of Beethoven’s own violent moral interference,
married a silly wife. He found it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to control her course, or even to get a divorce
from her, because he had made over to her a
part of his property, and was “inflexible” on
this very point. And so the brother was not
able, spite of many invitations, to induce
Beethoven to visit him even once on his estate
of Wasserhof, near Gneixendorf, on the Danube.
Ludwig wrote him, in the summer of
1823: “O accursed shame! Have you not a
spark of manhood in you? Shall I debase myself
by entering such company?” Yet, his
sister-in-law was “tamed” by degrees. But
the mother of the boy continued, now that he
was beginning to mature, to draw him into her
own baneful circle, and, as Beethoven wrote
in the summer of 1824, into the poisonous
breath of the dragon; and levity, falsehood
and unbecoming behavior towards his uncle,
who was at the same time a father to him,
followed. Carried away by the impulses of
his moral feelings, the latter was severe even
to harshness with the boy, and yet could not
dispense with the young man’s company because
of his increasing age and isolation. The
natural craving for love, moral severity and
the consciousness of paternal duty, wove the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
texture of which our artist’s shroud was made.</p>

<p>The correspondence of this year, 1824,
turns principally upon the pecuniary realization
from his new, great works; for he wanted
to be in London in the fall without fail. We
have also a letter of his about his will, to his
lawyer, Dr. Bach, dated in the summer. He
writes: “Only in divine art is the power
which gives me the strength to sacrifice to the
heavenly muses the best part of my life.”
We hear also the celestial sounds of the
<i>adagio</i>, op. 127, ringing in our ears. He was
himself filled with this true “manna;” for
he exclaims in these same summer days,
“Apollo and the muses will not yet allow me
to be delivered over to the hands of death, for
I yet owe them what the Spirit inspires me
with and commands me to finish. I feel as if
I had written scarcely a note.” And we
even now find the sketches of those pieces
expressive of a happiness more than earthly,
or else, in gay irony, of contempt for the existing
world, or of the mighty building up of
a new world; the <i>alla danza tedesca</i> and the
<i>poco scherzando</i> of op. 130, as well as the
great fugue, op. 133, which was intended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
be the original <i>finale</i> of op. 130, and which,
by its superscription, “overture” and the
gigantic strides in its theme, reminds us of
the plan of the <i>Bachouverture</i>. Even the unspeakably
deep melancholy and, at the same
time, blissful, hopeful <i>cavatina</i> of the same
third quartet op. 130, blossoms forth now
from the feeling of his heart, which has taken
into itself the full meaning of the eternal, and
is filled with a higher joy. We here find, as
in the last tones of Mozart’s soul, the germs
of a new and deep-felt language of the heart,
a real personal language, acquired to humanity
for the expression of its deepest secrets, and
which, in our own day, has led to the most
touching soul-pictures in art—to the transfiguration
of Isolde, and to Bruennhild’s dying
song of redeeming love.</p>

<p>A mighty seriousness overpowers him. The
desolate horrors that surround him endow him
with the power to understand more clearly
the higher tasks of the mind in which his
art had a living part. We see plainly that
his nature tends more and more towards the
one thing necessary—“All love is sympathy,”
sympathy with the sorrows of the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
says the philosopher. And so while his vision
takes an immense sweep over the field
of existence, we see that an inexhaustible
source of patient goodness and of the kindest
and most heartfelt love, springs up within
him. “From childhood up it was my greatest
happiness to be able to work for others,”
he once said; and again when the overture,
op. 24, was reproduced: “I was very much
praised on this account, etc. But what is
that all to the great Master of Tones above—above—above!
rightly the Most High, when
here below it is used only for purposes of ridicule.
Most high dwarfs!!!” We here listen
to the sublime irony of his tones in op. 130,
but also to the lustrous mildness of the <i>adagio</i>
of op. 127, in which in the little movement in
E major, the human soul itself, filled with the
spirit of the Eternal, so to speak, opens its eyes
and looks upward. “I am what is, I am all
that is, that was and that will be. No mortal
man has lifted my veil. He comes from Himself
alone, and to this Only One all things
owe their existence.” Beethoven wrote out
this Egyptian saying in this summer of 1824,
framed it and placed it on his writing table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
before him. He well knew what the really
creative and preserving deity in human life
is. That deity lived in his own most heartfelt
thought and feeling. It was to him a continual
source of bliss. It inspired his pen. To
it he was indebted for the poetic creations
which sprung unbidden from his brain.</p>

<p>The quartet in A minor, op. 132, belongs to
the spring and summer of 1825. His journey
to London had been postponed. Schindler
gives as the reason of this, the “bad behavior
of his dearly beloved nephew, which had become
somewhat notorious.” How could his
“son” be abandoned, thus unguarded, to “the
poisonous breath of the dragon?” But as the
invitation was renewed, the Tenth Symphony
was again taken in hand, and from the
sketches of it now made, we know all that is
certain about it. It was intended to do no
less than to add the “beautiful to the good,”
to wed the spirit of Christianity to the beauty
of the antique, or rather to transfigure the
mere worldly beauty of the antique in the
light of the superterrestrial. We find, indeed,
a picture of this kind, a direct, intentional,
higher picture of the world in the <i>adagio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in modo lidico</i>, in the second quartet. It is
called the “Song of Thanksgiving of a Convalescent
to the Deity,” and is a choral between
the repetitions of which, ever richer
and more heartfelt, the joyful pulsations of
new life are expressed. Beethoven had been
seriously sick during this spring. His affection
for his nephew had assumed, in consequence
of one continual irritation of his feelings,
the nature of a passion which tormented
the boy to death, but which, like every passion,
brought no happiness to Beethoven himself.
The first movement of this quartet in
A minor is a psychological picture—a poem of
the passions—the consuming character of
which can be explained only by this very
condition of the artist’s own soul. And how
Beethoven’s creations always came from his
own great soul, that soul so fully capable of
every shade of feeling and excitement! The
account left us by the young poet, Rellstab,
written in the spring of 1825, gives us a perfect
description of the state Beethoven was in
at this time. He describes him “a man with a
kindly look, but a look also of suffering.”
Beethoven’s own letters confirm the correctness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of this description. “In what part of me
am I not wounded and torn?” he cries out to
his nephew, whose frivolity had already begun
to bear evil fruit. On another occasion he
said: “O, trouble me no more. The man
with the scythe will not respite me much
longer.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, however, or perhaps
because of this extreme excitement of his
whole nature, the summer of 1825 was very
rich in productions. “Almost in spite of himself,”
he had to write the quartet in C sharp
minor (op. 131); after that in B flat major (op.
130). The last quartet also, that in F major,
had its origin in that “inexhaustible fancy”—a
fancy which always tended to the production
of such works. Hence it is that the
number of movements increases. The second
has five; the third (B flat major), six; and the
fourth (C sharp minor), seven—as if the old
form of the suite, or the <i>divertimento</i> of the
septet was to be repeated. But a moment’s
comparison immediately shows the presence of
the old organic articulation of the form of the
sonata. These movements are in fact only
transitions to, and connecting links between,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
two colossal movements. They increase the
usual number of movements, although frequently
nothing more than short sentences,
and at times only a few measures. But the
introductory movement and the <i>finale</i> in the
quartet in A minor loom up like the pillars
of Hercules, and determine the impassioned
character and the dramatic style of the whole.
Beethoven himself called it a piece of art
worthy of him. The same may be said of op. 130,
when the great fugue, op. 133, is considered
a part of it, which in our day it should always
be conceded to be. And how immensely great
is this spirit when, in the quartet in C sharp
minor, it awakes from the most profound contemplation
of self to the contemplation of the
world and its pain.—“Through sorrow, joy!”</p>

<p>We must refer the reader to the third
volume of <i>Beethoven’s Leben</i>, published in
Leipzig in 1877, for a detailed account of the
desolation of our artist, produced by the narrow
circle with which the restoration of Metternich
and Gentz surrounded him, at a time
when his own mind and feeling were expanding
to greater dimensions than ever before.
To the same source we must send him for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
description of the full earnestness and greatness
of this last period in the life of our artist.
In that work was for the first time presented
to the public, from original sources, and especially
from the records of Beethoven’s written
conversations, extant in the Berlin library,
the comfortless—but at the same time, and
spite of continual torment, intellectually exalted—picture
of his character. “Words are
interdicted. It is a fortunate thing that tones
are yet free,” wrote Ch. Kuffner, the poet of
the oratorio, <i>Saul and David</i>, to him at this
time—a work in which he wished to give expression
both to his own relation as a human
being to his “David,” and to the wonder-working
nature of his art. The execution of
this plan was prevented only by death. The
general demoralization which had invaded
Vienna with the Congress made its effects felt
directly in his own circle, through the agency
of his nephew, and thus paved the way for
disaster to himself. “Our age has need of
vigorous minds to scourge these paltry, malicious,
miserable wretches,” he cries out at this
very time to his nephew, who had permitted
himself to make merry, in a manner well calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
to irritate, at the expense of a genuine
<i>faijak</i>—as Beethoven was wont now to call
the good Viennese—the music-dealer Haslinger;
and the matter had become public.
But he adds to the above: “Much as my heart
resists causing pain to a single human being.”
And, indeed, his heart knew nothing of such
anger or vengeance. It was always a real sympathizer
with the sorrows born of human
weakness—a sorrow which with him swelled
to the dimensions of the world-sorrow itself.
To this feeling his op. 130 in B flat major is
indebted for its series of pictures, in which
we see the world created, as it were, anew with
a bold hand, with the ironic, smiling, melancholy,
humorous, cheerful coloring of the
several pieces—pieces which, indeed, are no
mere sonata movements, but full pictures of
life and of the soul. The <i>cavatina</i> overtops
it as a piece of his own heart, which, as he
admitted himself to K. Holz, always drew from
him “fresh tears.”</p>

<p>“Imitate my virtues, not my faults,” he
implores his “son.” Speaking of the rabble
of domestics, he says: “I have had to suffer
the whole week like a saint;” and, on another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
occasion, still more painfully: “May God be
with, thee and me. It will be all over soon
with thy faithful father.” His days, so
strangely divided between the loftiest visions
of the spirit and the meanest troubles of life,
henceforth render him more and more indifferent
to the latter. We find persons invade
his circle whom otherwise he would never
have permanently endured about him, and
who frequently led him into minor sorts of
dissipation even in public places. This reacted
on the nephew, whose respect for the
character of his “great uncle” could not long
stand a course of action apparently like his
own. But even now we see a picture in tones
of which one of the <i>faijaks</i>, the government
officer and dilettante, Holz, who copied it,
writes to Beethoven himself: “When one
can survey it thus calmly, new worlds come
into being.” We have reference to the quartet
in C sharp minor, op. 131. “With a look
beaming with light, dripping with sorrow and
joy,” young Dr. Rollett saw him at this
time in beautiful Baden, and, indeed, this
work, which he himself called the “greatest”
of his quartets, discloses to us, in a manner different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
from the Ninth Symphony, the meaning
of his own life, which he here himself, as
Richard Wagner has said, displayed to us, a
wild melody of pleasure and pain. But we
now recognize more clearly that something
“like a vulture is devouring his heart.” We,
indeed, are drawing near to the catastrophe
which led to his premature end.</p>

<p>As early as in the fall of 1825 he had witnessed
“stormy scenes.” An uncontrollable
love of gaming and a habit of loitering about
the streets had led the young man into worse
and worse courses, to falsehood and embezzlement.
And when these were discovered,
he secretly ran away from home. It was not
long, however, before the loving weakness of
his uncle called him back. The only effect
of this was henceforth to condemn Beethoven
himself to a slavish, too slavish life, one which
would have been a torment even to an ordinary
mortal, but which must have been doubly so
to a passionate, great man who was deaf. The
nephew found fault with his uncle, with his
“reproaches” and “rows.” He accused him
even of having led him into had company.
He dreaded other reproaches still and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
afraid of even personal violence. At last, one
day in the summer of 1826, the uncle received
the frightful news that his son had left his
dwelling with a pair of pistols, and intended to
take his own life. A long and terrible morning
was spent searching for the unfortunate
youth, who was finally led home, with a
wound in his head, from Baden. “It’s done
now. Torment me no longer with reproofs
and complaints,” he writes; and his disposition
and feeling may be inferred from the words
found in his conversation leaves: “I have
grown worse, because my uncle wanted to
make me better;” and from these others:
“He said it was not hatred, but a very different
feeling, that moved him against you.”</p>

<p>The uncle, alas! understood these expressions
better than those about him. These had
only words of reproach for the reprobate deed.
“Evidences of the deepest pain were plainly
to be seen in his bent attitude. The man, firm
and upright in all the movements of his
body, was gone. A person of about seventy
was before us—yielding, without a will, the
sport of every breath of air.” So wrote
Schindler. Beethoven called for the Bible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
“in the real language into which Luther
had translated it.” A few days later, we
find in his conversations the following memorandum:
“On the death of Beethoven.”
Did he mean his own death, or the death
of the beloved boy with whom he had, so to
speak, lost his own life? Be this as it
may, he now sang the deepest song of his
soul, and it was destined to be his dying song.
We refer to the <i>adagio</i> in the last quartet, op.
135. His harp soon after this grew silent, and
forever. Henceforth we have only projects or
fragments of works. But he touched it once
more, like King Gunther in the Edda, “seated
among serpents,” the most venomous of
which—the pangs of his own conscience—menaced
him with death. Among the pictures
in which he paints the meaning of a theme
similar to that of this <i>adagio</i> (pieces thus independent
of one another cannot rightly be
called variations), there is one whose minor
key and rhythm show it to be a funeral ceremony
of touching sublimity. But whatever guilt
he may have incurred he atoned for in his
heart of hearts by love. Such is this picture.
His soul is free. This the theme itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
tells us, eloquently and distinctly. Here the
soul, in melancholy stillness, revolves about its
own primeval source, and towards the close
plumes its wing for a happy, lofty flight, to
regions it has longed to enter. The other
pictures show us this full, certain and joyful
possession of one’s self, and the last even seems
to resolve the soul into its faculties when it
floats about the Eternal Being in the most
blissful happiness—a vision and condition
which, of all the means of expression of the
intellect, only music is able to describe, and
which proves to us that, in the case of our
artist, both fear and death had long been overcome.</p>

<p>And thus it comes that a movement with
which there is none to be compared, one which
to our feelings is the richest and most perfect of
all movements, and, at the same time, of the
most brilliant transparency, made its way into
a work which otherwise shows no trace of the
magnitude of this his last effort. For the
<i>finale</i> is only a sham-play of those magic
powers which our master so well knew how
to conjure up, both in sublime horror and in
saving joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>But his physical condition was soon destined
to be in keeping with the condition of his soul
above described. When, indeed, Karl was
convalescing as well as could be desired, and
he had decided to follow the military calling,
Beethoven’s friends noticed that, externally
at least, he again looked fresh and cheerful.
“He knew,” says Schindler, “how to rise
superior to his fate, and his whole character
bore an ‘antique dignity.’” But even now
he told the old friend of his youth, Wegeler,
that he intended “to produce only a few more
great works, and then, like an old child, to
close his earthly career somewhere among good
men.” And, indeed, his whole inner nature
seemed shattered. “What dost thou want?
Why dost thou hang thy head? Is not the
truest resignation sufficient for thee, even if
thou art in want?” This one conversation
with Karl tells us everything.</p>

<p>Besides, serious symptoms of disease appeared.
A single blow, and his powerful,
manly form was shattered like that of the
meanest of mortals. And, indeed, that blow
was struck with almost unexpected violence.</p>

<p>After his recovery, Karl was released by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
the police on the express condition that he
would remain in Vienna only one day more.
His scar, however, prevented his entering the
service. Where, then, could he go, now that
the fall was just beginning? His brother,
Johann, invited him to his Wasserhof estate
near Gneixendorf. He could no longer answer
as he had once: <i>non possibile per me</i>—impossible
for me. But his sojourn in a country
house not constructed so as to guard against
the cold and dampness, a want of attention to
his growing infirmity, misunderstandings with
his brother’s wife, a violent quarrel with the
brother himself, who, after it, refused him the
use of his close carriage, and, lastly, his departure
in the cold of winter in the “devil’s
own worst conveyance.” All these causes conspired
to send our patient back to Vienna, the
subject of a violent fit of sickness. In addition
to all this, his nephew delayed to call a physician,
and none visited his sick bed until the
third day after his return. The doctor who
came was not Beethoven’s customary physician,
and totally misunderstood the nature of the
disease. Other shocks succeeded, and the consequence
was a violent attack of dropsy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
symptoms of which had first shown themselves
in Gneixendorf.</p>

<p>His long, painfully long end was now beginning.
His constitution, powerful as that of
a giant, “blocked the gates against death” for
nearly three months. As labor of any kind
was out of the question, the arrival of Handel’s
works from London, which came to him
as a present, supplied him with the distraction
he wished for, in his own sphere. It
was not long before attacks of suffocation at
night distressed him and it became necessary
to perform the operation paracentesis. When
he saw the stream of water gush forth, he remarked,
with that sublimity of humor so peculiarly
his own, that the surgeon reminded
him of Moses, who struck the rock with his
rod; but, in the same humorous vein, he added:
“Better water from the stomach than from the
pen.” With this he consoled himself. But
he grew worse, and a medical consultation
seemed necessary to his friends. His own
heart forebode him no good, and he again
made his will on the 3rd of January, 1827.
He made his beloved nephew “sole heir to all
he possessed.” The nephew had gone to join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
his regiment the day before, and this had a
good and quieting effect on Beethoven. He
knew that the young man would be best provided
for there, and testified his gratitude to
General von Stutterheim, who had received
him, by dedicating to that officer his quartet
in C sharp minor—his “greatest” quartet.
He urged that Dr. Malfatti should be called.
But he had had a falling out years before with
him, and the celebrated physician did not now
want to excite the displeasure of his colleagues.
Schindler tells us: “Beethoven wept bitterly
when I told him the doctor’s decision.”</p>

<p>But Malfatti came at last, and, after they had
exchanged a few words, the old friends lay
weeping in each other’s arms. The doctor
prescribed iced punch to “quicken the organs
of digestion, enervated by too much medicine.”
The first physician who was called to
attend him tells us: “The effect of the prescription
was soon perceptible. He grew cheerful,
was full of witty sallies at times, and even
dreamt that he might be able to finish his oratorio
<i>Saul and David</i>.” From his written
conversations, we see that a great many of his
friends had gathered about his bed. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
thought of finishing the Bach overture for one
of Schindler’s concerts, and even began to
busy himself with the Tenth Symphony once
more. He had again to experience the feeling
of pecuniary embarrassment while in this condition—an
embarrassment now more painful
than ever—brought about more especially by
the necessity of procuring a military outfit for
Karl. Gallitizin had, indeed, expressly promised
a short time before to send him money,
but he proved a “princely boaster;” and there
was no prospect of an income from any other
source. All his completed works had been
sold, and the little fortune he had laid aside
at the time of the Congress of Vienna was
irrevocably pledged to Karl by his will.</p>

<p>His thoughts now turned to the “magnanimous”
English, who had already promised
him a “benefit.” His disease lasted a long time.
The third operation had been performed. His
long-continued solitude had alienated men
from him in Vienna; and, especially after his
experiences with the <i>Akademie</i> in 1824, he
had no confidence in the devotion and enthusiasm
for art of his second home. This
induced Schindler to write to England: “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
what afflicts him very much is, that no one
here concerns himself in the least about him;
and, indeed, this total absence of interest in
him is very surprising.” After this, we find
only his most intimate friends at his bedside.
Among these was Gleichenstein, who happened
to be in Vienna on a short visit. He writes:
“Thou must bless my boy as Voltaire blessed
Franklin’s son.” Hummel, who was traveling
and giving concerts, also saw him, and at
the sight of his suffering—he had just undergone
the fourth operation—burst into tears.
Beethoven had, at the moment of Hummel’s
visit, received a little picture as a present, and
he showed it to him, saying: “See, my dear
Hummel, the house in which Haydn was
born—the miserable peasant hut, in which so
great a man was born!”</p>

<p>He asks his Rhenish publisher, Schott, who
had purchased his Mass and his Ninth Symphony,
and who was destined one day to become
the owner of the <i>Niebelungen</i>, for some
old wine to strengthen him. Malfatti recommended
an aromatic bath; and such a bath, it
seemed to him, would surely save him. But
it had the very opposite effect, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
soon taken with violent pains. He wrote to
London: “I only ask God that I may be preserved
from want as long as I must here endure
a living death.” The response was one
thousand guldens from the Philharmonic Society
of that city “on account of the concert
in preparation.” “It was heart-rending to
see how he folded his hands and almost dissolved
in tears of joy and gratitude” when he
received them. This was his last joy, and the
excitement it caused accelerated his end. His
wound broke open again and did not close any
more. He felt this at first a wonderful relief,
and while he felt so he dictated some letters
for London, which are among the most beautiful
he has written. He promised to finish
the Tenth Symphony for the Society, and had
other “gigantic” plans, especially as regards
his Faust music. “That will be something
worth hearing,” he frequently exclaimed. The
overflow of his fancy was “indescribable, and
his imagination showed an elasticity which
his friends had noticed but seldom when he
was in health.” At the same time, the most
beautiful pictures of dramatic poetry floated
before his mind, and in conversation he always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
represented his own works as filled with such
“poetic ideas.” But his sufferings soon became
“indescribably great. His dissolution was
approaching” with giant steps, and even his
friends could only wish for his end. Schindler
wrote to London on the 24th March: “He
feels that his end is near, for yesterday he said
to Breuning and me: ‘Clap your hands,
friends; the play is over.’” And further:
“He advances towards death with really Socratic
wisdom and unexampled equanimity.”
He could well be calm of heart and soul. He
had done his duty as an artist and as a man.
This same day he wrote a codicil to his will
in favor of his nephew; and now his friends
had only one deep concern—to reconcile him
with heaven. The physician approved, and
Beethoven calmly but resolutely answered:
“I will.”</p>

<p>The clergyman came and Beethoven devoutly
performed his last religious duties.
Madame Johann van Beethoven heard him
say, after he had received the sacrament:
“Reverend sir, I thank you. You have
brought me consolation.”</p>

<p>He then reminded Schindler of the letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
to London, “May God bless them,” he said.
The wine he had asked for came. “Too bad!
too bad! it’s too late!” These were his very
last words. He fell immediately after into
such an agony that he was not able to utter a
single syllable more. On the 24th and 25th
of March, the people came in crowds to see
him again. Even the <i>faijaks</i>, Hoslinger and
Holz, as well as the poet Castelli, were among
them. “All three of us knelt before his bed,”
said Holz, subsequently, to Frau Linzbaur,
who, in relating the incident, added that when
Holz told it “his voice forsook him, and he
covered his face and wept. ‘He blessed us,’
he said, with an effort; ‘we kissed his hand,
but never saw him again.’” This was the last
act of his life.</p>

<p>“On the 26th, the little pyramidal clock,
which he had received as a present from
Princess Christiane Lichnowsky, stopped, as
it still does when a storm is approaching.
Schindler and Breuning had gone to the
churchyard, to select a grave for him. A
storm of loud thunder and hail came raging
on about five o’clock. No one but Frau van
Beethoven and the young composer, Anselm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Huettenbrenner, who had hurried hither from
Graz to look upon his revered master once
more, were present in the room of the dying
man. A stroke of lightning illuminated it
with a lurid flash. The moribund opened his
eyes, raised his right hand, and looked up with
a fixed gaze for several seconds: the soul of
the hero would not out. But when his uplifted
hand fell back on the bed, his eyes half
closed. Not another breath! Not another
heart-beat! It was I that closed the half-open
eyes of the sleeper.” So says Huettenbrenner,
an eye-witness of our artist’s last moment.
This was the 28th of March, 1827.</p>

<p>“No mourning wife, no son, no daughter,
wept at his grave, but a world wept at it.”
These are the words of the orator of the day
on the occasion of the unveiling of the first
monument to Beethoven in 1845, in Bonn.
But his funeral on that beautiful day in spring
was a very brilliant one. A sea of twenty
thousand human beings surged over the street
where now the votive church stands; for in
the <i>Schwarzspanierhaus</i> behind it, Beethoven
had lived during the last years of his life.
The leading <i>capellmeisters</i> of the city carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the pall, and writers and musicians the torches.</p>

<p>“The news of his death had violently shaken
the people out of their indifference,” says Dr.
G. von Breuning. And, indeed, it was, as a
poor old huxtress exclaimed when she saw the
funeral procession, “the general of musicians”
whom men were carrying to the grave! The
poet, Grillparzer, delivered the funeral oration.
He took for his text the words: “He was an
artist, and he was what he was only through
his art.” Our very being and our sublimest
feelings are touched when we hear the name
of</p>

<p>Of “Memories” the London <i>Academy</i> says: “It is a prose poem.
* * * It is seldom that a powerful intellect produces any
work, however small, that does not bear some marks of its special bent,
and the traces of research and philosophy In this little story are apparent,
while its beauty and pathos show us a fresh phase of a many-sided
mind, to which we already owe large debts of gratitude.”</p>

<p>Of “Graziella” the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> says: “It glows with love of the
beautiful in all nature. * * * It is pure literature, a
perfect story, couched in perfect words. The sentences have rhythm
and flow, the sweetness and tender fancy of the original. It is uniform
with ‘Memories,’ and it should stand side by side with that on the
shelves of every lover of pure, strong thoughts, put in pure, strong
words. ‘Graziella’ is a book to be loved.”</p>

<p>Of “Marie” the Cincinnati <i>Gazette</i> says: “This is a Russian love tale,
written by a Russian poet. It is one of the purest, sweetest little narratives
that we have read for a long time. It is a little classic, and a Russian
classic, too. That is one of its charms, that it is so distinctively Russian.
We catch the very breezes of the Steppes, and meet, face to face, the high-souled,
simple-minded Russian.”</p>

<p>Of “Madeleine” the New York <i>Evening Telegram</i> says: “More than
thirty years ago it received the honor of a prize from the French
Academy and has since almost become a French classic. It abounds
both in pathos and wit. Above all, it is a pure story, dealing with love
of the most exalted kind. It is, indeed, a wonder that a tale so fresh, so
sweet, so pure as this has not sooner been introduced to the English-speaking
public.”</p>

<p>“Admirable because of its brevity and directness, and because it answers,
without any theological circumlocution, the objections which
modern infidelity puts forth so pertinaciously.”—<i>Inquirer, Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p>“The book, both in manner and matter, will be found to be just the
thing which many thoughtful yet perplexed persons need to direct their
inquiries and resolve their doubts. The style is fresh, vigorous and incisive.”—<i>Canada
Presbyterian, Toronto.</i></p>

<p>“The book will be read with genuine interest by any one who thinks
at all on these noble themes, and we are sure that its effect will be
wholesome and powerful in removing difficulties, strengthening defenses,
and establishing the spirit upon sure foundations.”—<i>Observer,
New York.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Gibson’s book, though so condensed, is admirable in method, and
vigorous and fresh in style, throughout. As a brief and popular presentation
of the fundamental truths, such as are apt to expand beyond ordinary
ability to read in most hands, nothing more valuable has recently
emanated from the press.”—<i>Rev. Dr. H. M. Field, in the Evangelist.</i></p>

<p>“The treatment is masterly. The author grapples the points essential
to the argument with courage and vigor, and in a style notable for its
trenchant force, sets them forth in convincing light. While others meet
the infidel argument more on the skirmish line, Christian people will
be glad to see one like Dr. Gibson bearing down upon the very centre of
the enemy’s position.”—<i>Rev. Dr. J. A. Smith, in the Standard.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny">
<p>This Life of Arnold is full of new facts, now first given to the public.
Manuscripts from the family of Arnold, in England and in Canada, and
the Shippen manuscripts, have enabled the author to make new contributions
to Revolutionary history of great interest. The unpublished
manuscripts of General Schuyler, to which the author has had access,
has thrown new light upon the expedition to Canada and the campaign
against Burgoyne. The author does not, to any extent, excuse Arnold’s
treason, but aims to do full justice to him as a soldier and patriot. For
Arnold, the traitor, he has no plea but “guilty;” for Arnold, the soldier
and patriot, he asks a hearing and justice.</p>

<p>“The biographer discriminates fairly between Arnold’s patriotism and
baseness; and while exhibiting the former and the splendid services by
which it was illustrated, with generous earnestness, does not in any degree
extenuate the turpitude of the other.”—<i>Harper’s Monthly.</i></p>

<p>“The public is the gainer (by this book), as additional light is thrown
on the prominent actors and events of history. * * * Bancroft erroneously
asserts that Arnold was not present at the first battle of Saratoga.
Upon this point the author has justice and right on his side, and to
Arnold, rather than to Gates, the success of this decisive campaign seems
greatly attributable.”—<i>New England Historical and Genealogical Register.</i></p>

<p>“After a careful perusal of the work, it seems to us that Mr. Arnold has
accomplished his task wonderfully well. * * * It is rarely that one
meets in the pages of biographical literature a nobler woman than was
the devoted wife of Benedict Arnold; she mourned his fallen greatness,
but even in his ignominity was faithful to the vows by which she had
sworn to love and care for him until death.”—<i>Traveller, Boston.</i></p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
